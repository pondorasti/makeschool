## Exploring all the options 🔍

### Part 1

The class will be divided into groups. Each group will take 20 minutes to do a **quick/light** research on a specific method to save data. The purpose is to get a general idea of how it works, **you don't need to learn how to implement it now.**

During this time each member of the group will contribute in a discussion to agree on the following criteria for the method given:

- 3 key points describing the persistence method
- Pros
- Cons
- Mention some use cases

Methods to be assigned:
- FileSystem
- NSUserDefaults
- Keychain
- Plist
<!--- CoreData-->

## Part 2
Each group will fill out a corresponding slide for their method with the 4 points that were required.

## Part 3
In the order above, each team will share their findings with the rest of the class in no more than 5 minutes each.

At the end of each mini presentation, if a student from another team wants to add something they know already, their contributions can be added to the slide.
