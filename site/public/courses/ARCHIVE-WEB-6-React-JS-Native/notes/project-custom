# React Custom project

The goal of this challenge is to create a custom project with React. 
This project will be conceived and created by you. The project can 
be anything with the limitation that it **must be completed by the 
end of this term!** 

Within that limit realize that you can continue to work on the 
project beyond class. With that in mind what you complete this term
has to be focussed and core ideas, and scoped to fit the time 
available.
