# Tutorial Project 

The goal of this project is to create and complete the React Tutorial 
[here](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html). The 
tutorial has a description and notes. 

## Discussion

The tutorial is created through Codepen.io. CodePen is an online 
community for testing and showcasing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
code snippets. While you can't publish functional web projects through
CodePen you can create functioning demos and proof of concept examples
that you can easily share with the world. 

CodePen takes care of much of the infrastructure required to create 
React Projects. 

The tutorial creates a simple Tic Tac Toe game with React. Along the way 
it explains some core React concepts. Pay close attention to these. 

- What is React 
- Passing Data through Props
- Interactive Components 
- State and Components 
- Functional Components
- Lifting State

Look for these and pay close attention to them. 

## Challenges

The tutorial includes 5 challenges at the end. Be sure to solve all of these. 

1. Display the move locations in the format "(1, 3)" instead of "6".
2. Bold the currently-selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or 
descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
