# [Probability & Sampling](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rX0fkg-PdG_ypu4EL_cN_dDZ96UCrZkmEXeRRdT99lI/edit#slide=id.g6e846b49fc_2_76)

## Activities
- Compare code quality for histogram implementations
- Refactor code to improve readability, modularity, and performance
- Compare tradeoffs of different histogram implementations
    - Watch [video of histogram comparison whiteboard activity]
- Lecture and discussion following [probability and sampling slides]
    - Watch [video of probability and sampling lecture]

## Objectives
After completing this class session and the associated tutorial challenges, students will be able to ...
- Sample words according to their observed frequencies
- Compare tradeoffs with different sampling techniques
- Validate sampling techniques based on relative probabilities

## Challenges
These challenges are the baseline required to complete the project and course.
Be sure to complete these before next class session and before starting on the stretch challenges below.
- [Page 4: Stochastic Sampling]
    - Sample words by observed frequency weighting
    - Test relative probabilities to validate sampling technique

## Stretch Challenges
These challenges are more difficult and help you push your skills and understanding to the next level.
- [Page 4: Stochastic Sampling]
    - Optimize for speed of sampling (read time)
    - Optimize for memory (use the least amount of space)
    - Solve with only lists and tuples
    - Combine other weighting techniques

## Resources
- Review Make School's [probability and sampling slides]
- Consult Python's [random module] documentation, but *do not* use the `random.choices` function (the challenge is to implement this yourself)
- If you're *really* stuck, read the Python Cookbook's [Randomly Picking Items with Given Probabilities], but *don't read this until you've tried to solve it yourself*
