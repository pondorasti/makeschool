## Activities
  - Do you know what is XSS?
    - Pair and research about it
  - Scan your app on Internet to check if there is a XSS vulnerability
  - Research ways to defend your site/app by blocking XSS
  - Research about CORS: what it is, how to use it?

## Objectives
  - Learn about XSS
  - Discover how XSS attacks works
  - Discover ways to mitigate XSS attacks
  - Learn about CORS
  - Make the connection between XSS and CORS

## Challenge
  - Use the resources to read more about CORS and how to enable it in client/server
  - Read about other similar vulnerabilities in OWASP

## Stretch Challenge
  - Use the app provided to explore an XSS and then patch it (see notes in app on how to explore).
