# Managing a hotel

Your are going to model a hotel managing system.

Business Rules:

- For every hotel we track the **address** and **number of rooms**.

- More details about the rooms:
  - they are all numbered
  - there are 4 different types of rooms: single, double, triple and quad
  - ranging from 10 dlls to 40 dlls per night.

- Every hotel has a manager. We also need to know their **name**.

- There are also guests, who can book rooms. Guests can have or not, a pet.

- There is a 25 dlls fee per stay if guests bring pets.

- To register a booking we need to know:
  - who is booking the room
  - for how many days 
  - and give them the final price
