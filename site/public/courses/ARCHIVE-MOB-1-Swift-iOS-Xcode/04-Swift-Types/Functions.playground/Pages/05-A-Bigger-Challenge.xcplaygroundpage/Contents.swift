 # A "bigger" challenge

 ## Drawing a bigger square

 - callout(Challenge): Time to put those function skills to the test. In the last page you should have defined a `drawSquare` function. Define a `drawBigSquare` function in the space below. This new function should draw a square with sides _twice_ the length of your previous `drawSquare` function.

 
 - important: Remember to call the `drawBigSquare` function once it's defined and make sure the visualization works as expected.

 Feel free to reference the previous page if you need some help!
