## Xcode

## Swift


## Playgrounds

Playgrounds allow you to quickly execute code without building a full fledge iOS app. It allows you to quickly iterate and test out features.

We will be using playgrounds throughout the class to practice Swift and iOS fundamentals.

Some of the class reading will be in playground format, so you can read, practice and execute code all in one file.

To view the playground markup you will have to change the display mode of playgrounds as illustrated below
