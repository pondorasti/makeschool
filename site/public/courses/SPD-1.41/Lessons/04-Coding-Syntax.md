## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this class,  you should be able to...

1. Recall coding conventions and explain why they are important.
1. Recognize when important coding syntax and conventions have been broken to practice following them closely during technical interviews.

## Activity: Fix the Coding and Syntax Errors and Conventions (25 minutes)

### Part 1: FizzBuzz in JavaScript

Review this code snippet and find what’s wrong with it. What coding syntax errors does it have? Which conventions does it violate? How would you fix these?

Compare your results with 2-3 others and write down anything they caught but you had missed.

## Homework

- Copy your Google Doc solutions to 2 breakout problems solved during today’s class.
- Paste the code exactly as it is written in a code editor and commit it without changes.
- See if the code runs and the results are correct.
- Make any changes needs to fix the code’s syntax. Use a code linter to detect violated conventions.
- Commit the new code with your improvements.
- Submit your code via Gradescope.
