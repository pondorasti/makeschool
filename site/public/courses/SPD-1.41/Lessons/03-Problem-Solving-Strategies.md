## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, you will be able to describe and practice each of the problem-solving setps of the technical interview process:

1. Generate reasonable test inputs
1. Understand & solve the problem
    1. Simplify the problem if needed
1. Find a pattern in your solution
1. Make a plan - write pseudocode
1. Follow your plan - write real code
1. Check your work - test your code

## Warm-Up (15 minutes)

_**Interview Question:** Find the 5th largest value in an array of n numbers._

Write in your notebook, then share with 1 or 2 partners:

1. Restate the problem
1. Ask clarifying questions
1. State your assumptions
1. Think out loud
    1. Brainstorm solutions
    1. Explain your rationale
    1. Discuss tradeoffs
    1. Suggest improvements

## Activity: Interview Breakouts (40 minutes)

**Instructions**:

1. Find a partner to do mock interviews with. One will play interviewer, one interviewee.
1. Work through the problem as if you’re in an actual interview. Your interviewer will have a checklist to make sure you follow the best-practice problem solving steps.
1. Give feedback on what they did/didn’t do.
1. Swap roles and work through problem 2.
1. Find a different partner and repeat the above steps (2-4) for problems 3 and 4.

**Practice Problems**:

1. Given an array `a` of numbers and a target value `t`, find two numbers that sum to `t` (that is, `a[i]` + `a[j]` = `t`).
1. Given 2 arrays of `n` numbers each, find a pair of numbers (one from each array) whose sum is closest to a given target value `t`.
1. Reverse a linked list by reusing the nodes (do not create new nodes).
1. Find the k largest numbers in a an array of n numbers. Return them in an array sorted in decreasing order.
