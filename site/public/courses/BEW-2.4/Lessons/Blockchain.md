## [**02m**] 🏆 Objectives

1. Define the terms **blockchain** and **ledger**.
1. Understand the structure and properties of the blockchain and the blocks within it.
1. Build a small **blockchain library** in Python.

## [**03m**] 🤔 Why Learn Blockchain?

> Blockchain is a powerful technology with applications in fields such as cryptocurrency, healthcare, insurance, government, music, identification, supply chain, data management, and many more. By understanding the fundamental mechanisms that power blockchain, you can join the conversation and discover use cases for blockchain in your own life and work. - [**Codecademy**](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-blockchain)

Read [Blockchain's Secret 1,000 Year History](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliversmith/2018/03/23/blockchains-secret-1000-year-history), then write down the answers to the following questions.

- Is the Yap currency **centralized** or **decentralized**?
- Through which medium was the ledger **distributed**?

## [**15m**] 📖 Overview: What is a Blockchain?

### Blockchain: Spreadsheet in the Sky

![blockchain: spreadsheet in the sky](https://media.blockchainhub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/What-is-Blockchain_SpreadsheetInTheCloud.png)

A **blockchain** is a **distributed software network** that functions as:

- A digital **ledger** that exists over a peer-to-peer network.
- A mechanism enabling the **secure transfer of assets without an intermediary**.
- A **permanent forensic record of transactions** and a single version of the truth. Digital signatures and cryptography are used to prove identity, authenticity, and enforce rights to read and write to the chain. Ensures it's hard to change historical records, or at least make it easy to detect when someone is attempting to.
- Facilitates the exchange of value or financial transaction represented in digital units.

## [**15m**] 👥 Breakouts: Blockchain Vocabulary

Define the following terms in your breakout groups.

Use [Blockchain for Beginners](https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-for-beginners/) as a guide.

### Terms

- Transaction
- Block
- Mining
- Consensus

We will discuss these terms together after the breakout.
