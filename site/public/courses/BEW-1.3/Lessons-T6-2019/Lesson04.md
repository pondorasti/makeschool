## Competencies & Objectives (5 Minutes)

1. List the various forms of persistence that web developer can utilize across the client-server stack.
1. Compare and contrast the various forms of persistence and list their use cases.
1. Utilize the browser developer tools to review the status of client-side persistence.
1. Use the command line or GUI interfaces to explore server-side databases.

## Overview (8 Minutes)

If you are a web developer, where can you store data? At first you probably just thought "the database", but as we delve deeper into web development, we learn there is a lot more options than that, and each one has a different function and use cases.

## In Class Activity II - Challenges (90 Minutes)

### Baseline Challenges

1. Research each of the following forms of persistence: 1) where this persistence lives, 2) when the data would be deleted, 3) at least three use cases for each.
    1. LocalStorage
    1. Cookies
    1. SessionStorage
    1. Sessions
    1. A Database
    1. Client-side cache
    1. Serve-side cache
    1. A remote cache (e.g. Redis)
    1. A remote services (e.g. AWS S3, RabbitMQ, PubNub)
1. (_Optional_) Feel free to take a **10 MINUTE BREAK** after completing this step.
1. Pick one form of persistence and write a ~750 word technical blog post about its history and how it is currently used.
1. Post this blog post on [Medium](https://medium.com), [r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), or [dev.to](https://dev.to).

### Stretch Challenges

1. Read the following articles on Redis to learn more about how this powerful and flexible service helps make websites more scalable through caching and messaging.
    1. [How to take advantage of Redis just adding it to your stack](http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/take-advantage-of-redis-adding-it-to-your-stack.html)
    1. [11 Common Web Use Cases Solved In Redis](http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/7/6/11-common-web-use-cases-solved-in-redis.html)

## After Class

* Remind students that their **blog posts are due next class period at the start of class**.
* Encourage students to continue work on the Reddit tutorial.
