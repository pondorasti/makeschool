## Images 

The img tag and the background-image property in CSS have different uses.

Use an img when you have a picture of something that is content. You're talking about a product and you want to show it's picture, or you're listing the name of an employee next to their picture. 

When an image is part of the design of a page use the background-image property. Use the background image when you need more control over an image.
