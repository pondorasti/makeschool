HTML is the structural foundation for all web applications.

There are a few rules to writing good HTML.

## Learning Objectives

## Initial Exercise

- Think pair share: "what is HTML" where have you seen it before?
  - How do you use it?
  - What are those tags and what do they mean?
    - Talk about your previous experience with HTML

## Overview Lecture

- HTML is the structure that underlies the web.
  - The web is built on a highly sophisticated separation of concerns
    - HTML/CSS/JavaScript
  - Every web page is built from HTML
    - HTML defines the DOM
- Name some HTML tags you know?
  - List on board
  - Q: When and how do you use these tags?
- Some tags: 
  - p, h1, img, ul + li, div, a
- Concept: Semantic HTML
  - Semantic HTML = **Picking the tag that best describes its content**
  - Examples
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Define_terms_with_HTML 
- Vocabulary
  - Tag: `<p>`
  - Element: `<p>Hello World</p>`
  - Attribute and Values: `<p id="foo" class="bar">Hello World</p>`
        - id is an attribute 
        - foo is a value
        - Attribute values should always be quoted

## In Class Activity I

- I do: Writing HTML tags elements and attributes. 
  - Example 1
- We do: Choosing the right tag for the job
  - Example 2
- You do: Pair up and explore the tag list
  - [https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp)
- Complete challenges examples 1-6
  - Add markup to the text in the example files to the best of your ability. Read the content closely and consider what is there. Choose tags that best describe and add meaning to that content. 
    - [Challenge 1](challenge-1.html)
    - [Challenge 2](challenge-2.html)
    - [Challenge 3](challenge-3.html)
    - [Challenge 4](challenge-4.html)
    - [Challenge 5](challenge-5.html)
- Q&A about tutorials

## After Class

- Start working on the [tutorial](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/we-sell-shoes)
  - You can also view the tutorial [here](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/We-Sell-Shoes)
  - **Challenge**: While working on the tutorial look closely at the HTML. Ask yourself about the semantic quality of the HTML. Look for places where this could improve. This will involve: 
    - Replacing tags with more descriptive tags 
    - Adding tags to add context to content

  Explore the tag list [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element). 
  Look for tags that best describe the content in the examples. Be sure to read the description for the tags you are using to get an idea for how the tag is meant to be used. 
  - Have another student review your 
    - Take notes and incorporate any suggestions
- Review the work of another student
  - Look at the work closely and offer your best suggestions for improvement
