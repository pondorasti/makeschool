**Outcome 1: Build game projects using Xcode, Swift, SpriteKit.**

Ways we learned about this in the course
- Over a span of several lessons we built a game in SpriteKit covering:
  - Nodes
  - Actions
  - Touch events
  - Collisions
  - Game mechanic
  - Working with cameras
  - Juice (particles, sound, labels)

Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
- Identify the main elements needed to build a game with SpriteKit.
- Describe different methods to add "juice" to a game.

**Outcome 2: Identify trade offs of different gaming architectures and select the best fit for a game.**

Ways we learned about this in the course
- Class 8 covered architecting a game

Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
- Describe different architectures that can be applied to gaming projects.

**Outcome 3: Execute debugging strategies specific to iOS games**

Ways we learned about this in the course
- Debugging the in class game & your own project during labs.
- Using the physics body outlines.
- Reading metrics on screen: fps, number of nodes, number of light sources, etc.

Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
- Identify the importance of knowing certain information at runtime.
- Relationship between fps and nodes.

**Outcome 4: Integrate native game engines into an iOS project.**

Ways we learned about this in the course
- Used SpriteKit + Physics
- Used SceneKit at an introductory level + Physics
- State machines
- Introductory GameKit

Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
- Understand how Physics works with SpriteKit (physics bodies and masks)
- Identify the purpose of state machines delegate methods.
- Know what can be added to a game using GameKit.
- Know similarities and differences between SpriteKit & SceneKit
