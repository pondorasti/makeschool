## [**60m**] :computer: **Activity**: Juice Shop

> Being a web application with a vast number of intended security vulnerabilities, the OWASP Juice Shop is supposed to be the opposite of a best practice or template application for web developers: It is an awareness, training, demonstration and exercise tool for security risks in modern web applications. The OWASP Juice Shop is an open-source project hosted by the non-profit Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and is developed and maintained by volunteers. Check out the link for more information and documentation on the project: **<https://owasp-juice.shop>**

Use everything you learned in the Hacksplaining guides to exploit the [OWASP Juice Shop](https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/#/).
