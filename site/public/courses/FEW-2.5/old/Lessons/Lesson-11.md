# FEW 2.5 D3 workshop

D3 Scales provide a system for normalizing and scaling values for display on the screen. 


## Why? 

Scaling and nomralizing data is an important task you'll do it all the time. D3's scale tools provide great functionality. 

## Learning Objectives/Competencies

1. Identify scales and uses for normalizing
1. Define a scale for each axis 
1. Use the d3.scaleLinear() and 
1. Differentiate between scaleLinear and scaleOrdinal

## Scale and normalization

Scaling and normalizing allows us to convert values of any range into values that can be displayed on the screen. 

Scaling and normalizing works best when working with numbers. Sometimes you'll have values that don't normalize easily. For example names of countries and key words don't translate easily to numbers. Also there are situations where you want to categorize values into buckets. D3 scaleOrdinal does this for you. 

Use scaleOrdinal for:

- Converting values to colors
- Converting values into key words
- Converting keywords into a values, colors, or other things
