# FEW 2.2 - CSS Drawing

## Description 

For this assignment you need top recreate all of the drawings that in the sample document. The answers are in the document but you should try and do them on your own. You can peek at the source code if you get stuck. It' simportant to understand the CSS concepts used here. 

There are 16 small images in the grid. You should reacreate each image in the grid as close as possible. 

### Why this assignment?

To be a master at CSS you should be able to push it to it's limits. CSS wasn't really meant as a tool for drawing which is what makes this a challenge!

Creating the drawings in this assignment will giev you an opportunity to practice with CSS position absolute and transform properties. 

## Project requirements

Recreate each of the the 16 drawings in the example file. Each of the drawings is in a 50px by 50px box. You're going to recreate each at twice that size 100px by 100px. Otherwise try to make your drawings look the same as what is shown.
