The purpose of the technical article assignment is to learn more about a topic related to computer science and produce a high quality article that demonstrates your learning and ability to effectively communicate technical ideas in writing.
###Guidelines for Getting Started

## Technical Article Requirements

1. **Images and Diagrams:** Your article must include 3 or more images. Although meme images might make your article more fun to read, at least 3 images must be relevant to the topic, like a diagram that visually illustrates a point made in the article.

2. **Code Sample:** You must include a code sample (or at least pseudocode for an algorithm) that illustrates some point from your article.
There is no specific length requirement for your code sample, but it should be relevant and help reinforce the reader’s understanding of your topic.

3. **Article Length:** Your finished article must be 400 to 800 words long.

4. **Publishing:** You must publish your article online for the world to read. For this assignment, please submit a Google Doc, but after completion of this course, I recommend that you post a revised version to Medium to share on your portfolio.

## Guidelines for Writing a Technical Article:
#### Selecting a Topic
1. Your topic MUST be related to computer science. Ideally the topic is covered directly in CS 1.2 or 1.3, or something related.

2. Data Structures and Algorithm Related Ideas (automatically approved):
  * How binary numbers work and why computers use binary to store all information in memory and on disk
  * What a stack is, how it works, and examples of what it’s used for (function call stack, ‘undo’ feature, etc.)
  * How a hash table works and a comparison of how to resolve hash collisions (chaining vs. open addressing)
  * What a binary search tree is and how it allows very fast operations on Facebook-scale data (i.e., billions)
  * How iOS’s Grand Central Dispatch framework uses queues to manage concurrent task threads
  * What the birthday paradox is and how it’s related to the likelihood of a collision in a hash table
  * How the Pandas library’s DataFrame class uses arrays for efficiency and hash tables for convenience
  * How engineers used dynamic programming and distributed algorithms to find the best Rubik’s cube solutions
  
3. If you have questions about whether your topic idea is related enough, contact the instructor for feedback/guidance.
 
4. If you are torn between a couple of topics, try narrowing your options down to 2-3 ideas initially. Then do some basic research on your potential topics. You can circle back later once you have an idea of what your article might look like. Hopefully through initial research, you’ll learn which topic you are most excited about.

#### Researching Your Topic
* If you’re writing about a feature in a programming language, library, or framework, always consult the official documentation to avoid making technical errors in your article. Other resources are of course welcome, but the official docs are most reliable.
* Be sure to cite and link all sources that you use to back up your statements and to credit other authors or image creators.
* Plagiarism or copying without citing the original source will not be tolerated and will be dealt with according to Make School’s academic honesty and integrity policy. Violating the policy will also cause you to fail the course.

#### Creating Your Outline
* Make a plan, then use that plan to help you write. Beginning with a good outline will make it easier to write your final article. As you do your research, jot down anything that you think would fit into the context of your article.
* Organize your written down ideas into 3-5 sections, grouping similar ideas together and separating different ideas into their own section. 

#### Writing Your Article
* Begin writing the article section by section. You might have to revisit the documentation and other articles that you read before in order to beef up these sections.
* Make sure to incorporate your own ideas. Anything that you found interesting or enlightening when you were doing research. If you have ideas for an analogy that might make the topic more accessible, definitely include that to communicate the idea.


#### Citations
* You MUST cite ALL borrowed material (sentences, paragraphs, images, diagrams, and code) and link to its source to properly credit the original author. ALL borrowed text must be in a quotation to show readers it’s from another source.
* If you created an image, you should indicate this somehow (could simply be “I drew this linked list diagram in Sketch”).
* Plagiarism or copying anything without citing the original source will not be tolerated and will be dealt with according to Make School’s academic honesty and integrity policy. Violating the policy will also cause you to fail the course.
