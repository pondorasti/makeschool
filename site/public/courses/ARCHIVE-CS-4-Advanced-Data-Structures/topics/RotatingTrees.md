## Rotating Binary Search Trees

### Topics
- [Self-balancing binary search trees] with [rotations]: [AVL tree], [splay tree]

### Resources
- Review Make School's [binary search tree resources]
- Read Vaidehi Joshi's [AVL tree article][BaseCS AVL tree] with beautiful drawings
- Play with VisuAlgo's [interactive AVL tree visualization][VisuAlgo bst] to follow rotations step-by-step
- Watch MIT's [AVL tree video lecture] to learn how maximum tree height is related to the golden ratio
- Read Julia Geist's [AVL tree article] and [AVL tree slides] with animations and code samples
- Play with USF's [interactive animations of AVL trees][USF AVL tree] and [splay trees][USF splay tree]
