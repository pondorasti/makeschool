## Structural Patterns

Structural design patterns ease design by identifying a simple way to **establish relationships between entities**.

They can assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures **flexible** and **efficient**.

<!--- **Adapter** - Can be used when the wrapper must respect a particular interface and must support polymorphic behavior.
- **Decorator** makes it possible to add or alter behavior of an interface at run-time.
- **Facade** is used when an easier or simpler interface to an underlying object is desired. *(We will learn more about Facade in next lesson.)*

### The Adapter Pattern

**Analogy**

<img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/adapter/adapter-comic-1-en-2x.png">

<aside class="notes">
If you've traveled to Europe and you are from America, or vice versa, you noticed that you couldn't plug in most of your electronics to charge the,. The power plugs and sockets are different. You need to get a plug adapter that has the American-style socket and the European-style.
</aside>

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Scenario**

<img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/adapter/problem-en-2x.png">

<aside class ="notes">
You want to create an app the monitors the stock market. Apparently Game Stop's stock is growing like crazy and you want to check that out.

Your app downloads the data from multiple sources in XML format. And you want to display this data in nice-looking charts for your users.

You got traction with your app and decided you wanted to add a 3-rd party library for analytics. But the library can only work with data in JSON format.
</aside>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
What can you do? What are your thoughts?  🤔

Share them in the chat.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Possible Solution**

<img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/adapter/solution-en-2x.png">

<aside class="notes">
You can create an adapter. One that will transform you data from XML to JSON so that you code can directly communicate with the analytics library. Therefore, you should make your code communicate to the library only through this adapter.
</aside>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Formal definition

**Adapter lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.**

Provides a link between two elements that otherwise would not fit with each other by wrapping the **adaptee** with a class that supports the interface required by a client.

It decouples the client from the class of the targeted object.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### Implementation Notes

The key idea in this pattern is to work through a *separate adapter* that adapts the interface of an (already existing) class **without changing it.**
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Adapter is typically composed of four main *actors*:

1. **Adaptee** - Defines an existing interface that needs adapting.
2. **Adapter** - Adapts/converts the incompatible interface of a class (Adaptee) into another interface that clients require.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
3. **Target** - Defines the domain-specific interface that the Client uses.  
4. **Client** - Collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface.
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
And how they all work happens in 4 steps:

![steps](assets/adapterSteps.png)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
1. Client makes a request.
2. The adapter takes the request and searches for the method needed to be called with knowledge from both API's
3. The component gets the request, does the job and returns it to the adapter.
4. The adapter translates the response.
5. The response is handled to the client.
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
The __*Adapter object*__ does the actual work - it "wraps" the original object and adds new requirements specified by the Target.

The pattern is implemented correctly when the adapter allows a component to be integrated into the application **without requiring modification** of the existing application modules or the component.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Best Practices in Swift**

__*Use Protocols*__ -  The *design* of iOS protocols does not perfectly match the description of the Adapter pattern, though it achieves the *goal* of the pattern: allowing classes with otherwise incompatible interfaces to work together.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
__*Use Class Extensions*__ - The most elegant way to implement the Adapter pattern is with a Swift extension.

Extensions allow you to add functionality to classes that you are unable to modify.

This functionality includes adding conformance to a protocol, which is perfectly suited to implementing the Adapter pattern.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Example

[Link to example](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-2.4-Advanced-Architectural-Patterns-in-iOS/blob/master/Lessons/05-Structural-PatternsPt.1/assignments/adapterExample.md)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Problems Addressed

The Adapter pattern solves problems like:

- *How can a class be reused that does not have an interface that a client requires?*
- *How can classes that have incompatible interfaces work together?*
- *How can an alternative interface be provided for a class?*
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Problems that Adapter solves arise when **an existing system** needs to integrate a **new component** that has a **similar function** but that doesn’t present a common interface and that cannot be modified.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Another key use of Adapter arises *when you do not have access to the original source code.* Incompatible code can be introduced into a project when:

- a __*third-party component*__ is used
- or when you depend on the code produced by another development team working on a related project.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
| **Pros** | **Cons**  |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Integrate components when you can't modify source code    | Code complexity increases      |
| Single Responsibility Principle    | Forcing non intended integrations      |
| New functionality without breaking code   |      |
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### When to use

Classes, modules, and functions can’t always be modified, especially if they’re from a third-party library. Sometimes you have to adapt instead!
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Use Adapter...

- when you need to integrate a component that provides similar functionality to other components in the application but that uses an incompatible API.
- during the implementation of third-party classes when there is a mismatch in the interface and it does not tally with the rest of application code.

Adapter is also very often used in systems based on some legacy code.

**Continued Stretch Challenge:** Extend the Media Player app you created and improved in previous classes by implementing the following using either the Adapter or the Decorator pattern:

- Add functionality so that the user can skip to the `Next` or `Previous` video clip
(This will require that you have a collection of several video clips)
