## Class 4: Flask Web App Development

### Activities
- Compare implementations for sampling words based on observed frequency
- Visualize how sampling algorithms work by drawing pictures with a number line
- Discuss tradeoffs of different sampling techniques based on histogram implementations

### Objectives
After completing this class session and the associated tutorial challenges, students will be able to ...
- Set up Python virtual environments for package isolation
- Build and test simple Flask web apps on local computers
- Deploy Flask web apps to Heroku cloud hosted servers

### Challenges
These challenges are the baseline required to complete the project and course.
Be sure to complete these before next class session and before starting on the stretch challenges below.
- [Page 5: Flask Web App]
    - Set up an isolated virtual environment with `virtualenv`
    - Develop a Flask web app locally (access via `localhost`)
    - Push your Flask web app to Heroku servers (on the Web)

### Stretch Challenges
These challenges are more difficult and help you push your skills and understanding to the next level.
- [Page 5: Flask Web App]
    - Improve the style of your page with CSS
    - Display more than one generated word
    - Generate a specific number of words given in a URL query string parameter (like `/?num=10`)
    - Add a button to display a new word (i.e. refresh the page) when clicked
    - Add a button and route to store favorites (chosen by users) with a database
