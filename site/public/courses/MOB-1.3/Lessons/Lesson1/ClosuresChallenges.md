
# Closures Challenges

### Exercise 1

Write a closure that prints the string "Learning Swift" and assign the closure to a variable. Then call the closure.

### Exercise 2

Write a closure that takes two integers and returns the sum of the integers. Assign the closure to a variable and then call the closure. The closure can be written in a few different ways. Experiment and try 2 ways.

### Exercise 3

Sort the array:

```Swift
let numbers = [22, 10, 42, 100, 8, 4]
```
Use a closure and the `sorted(by:)` method.

### Exercise 4

Write a function that takes a closure as input and calls that closure.

### Exercise 5

Write a function that returns a closure. The function should contain the following variable:

```
let message = "This is an important message"
```

The closure that the function returns should print the value of that variable.
