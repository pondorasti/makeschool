# SPD 1.2 Agile Development & UI/UX

## Course Description

Term two focuses on the foundational skills of successful engineering teams. In pairs, you and your partner will build an app using “lean product development” methodology, the industry standard for engineering team collaboration. You'll learn SCRUM planning, an agile process used to ensure that your app meets user needs and technical specifications.

This class also covers how to make a seamless user experience (UX) based on an effective user interface (UI). We utilize design concepts inherent in the world’s most popular apps: information hierarchy, system state, grid systems, onboarding teardowns, typography and color. By the end you and your partner will each ship a beautiful app that delights users.

## Why you should know this

Beautifully designed apps are a critical part of your portfolio - recruiters often notice design first and then look at the backend. Whether or not you end up becoming a front end developer, the tools you'll use in this course will give you the language to interface with design teams, understand user psychology, and practices to creating exceptional products.

## Class Assignments

We will be using [Gradescope](gradescope.com), which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. *All assigned work will be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope.*

As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your Gradescope login is your Make School email, and your password can be changed at [https://gradescope.com/reset_password](https://gradescope.com/reset_password). The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.

## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Complete the [Product Landing Page] tutorial (submit proof of working Product Landing Page project)
- Complete and turn in all required projects listed in the assignment schedule (see each project for individual evaluation criteria)  
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences

## Attendance
Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
