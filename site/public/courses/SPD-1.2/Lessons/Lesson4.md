    - *Sprint Planning* - You and your partner will plan a "Sprint," the industry term for a set period of time to accomplish particular engineering tasks. Professional engineering teams conduct "sprint planning" to prioritize features and bugs, estimate times to complete tasks (also known as "tickets"), and address any other issues the team faces. Throughout the rest of this term, you and your partner will conduct 3 sprints to build your product idea.
    - *Pair-Programming* - learn how to "pair program" effectively with your partner. This is an industry practice where two engineers collaborate together at one workstation, simultaneously controlling the same screen. Pair programming allows you to catch errors, adapot each other's effective coding habits, and sync your thinking on your project.
