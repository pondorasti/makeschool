## Attendance Policy

Each student will be allowed **2 (two) unexcused absences** and **2 (two) excused absences** per course per term.

## Class Recordings

Class recordings will be available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ACry7MDrAS3UJzid6zDeoP-AqAc3z1rIWIFRKEecnE/edit#). For privacy reasons, please do not share the recordings outside of the Make School student body.

## Academic Honesty Policy

At Make School, we highly encourage collaboration between students on assignments. Working with other people is the best way to learn!

However, there's a big difference between **collaboration** (writing code together with another person) and **plagiarism** (copying code from a classmate or outside source without providing proper attribution). 

Here are some guidelines to follow in order to avoid plagiarism:

1. If you are looking at an outside source for help, **close the window** containing the code before writing your own solution.
1. Do not write down a line of code unless you **completely understand** how it works. (This is true even if the source you're referencing is the lesson slides/examples/etc!)
1. If your code is still similar to an outside source or another student's, **provide attribution** by adding a comment to your code explaining where it was taken from.

We take academic honesty very seriously at Make School. The consequences for violating the policy are as follows:

- You will be required to write a [Self-Reflection Letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/140_PHfDh7gu33OZI_caxEtvNzAlAepjnGcbQcXZ-MRo/edit?usp=sharing) to reflect on how your actions affected others.
- If this is your first offense, you may be permitted to redo the assignment for a reduced grade (at the instructor's discretion).
- The incident will be added to your permanent record at Make School and you may be placed on a Participation Improvement Plan (PIP).

For subsequent offenses, more serious consequences may be considered. For more information, please see [Make School's academic honesty policy](https://make.sc/academic-honesty-policy).
