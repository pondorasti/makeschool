    "Recall the architecture of a typical neural network.  The network is is made out of layers of neurons.  Each neuron in layer **_L_** takes in all the outputs from the previous layer (**_L - 1_**), computes an ouput, and passes that along to every neuron in the next layer (**_L + 1_**). Recall that when we talk about the layers of a neural network, we typically aren't talking about the _input layer_, only the **_hidden layer(s)_** and **_output layer_**.  Take a look at the following diagram for a refresher.  Each circle represents a neuron, and each line represents a weight.  \n",

In this case, it takes our 1-dimensional weight vector and rotates it so that we can easily compute the dot product of our weight vector and X, our inputs.  For example, a 4 x 1 vector would become a 1 x 4 vector.  \n",

    "The final activation function we'll look at in this lesson is a special one--the **_SoftMax_** activation function.  This function is special in that it is primarily only ever used for the output layer in a neural network.  Much like the sigmoid activation function, SoftMax outputs probabilities between 0 and 1.  Recall that we use sigmoid for _binary classification_ problems--when used as the activation function for the output layer, the float value between 0 and 1 corresponds to the percentage chance that the input is or isn't the thing you're trying to detect.  But what about problems such as the iris dataset, where we have more than two classes? This is where SoftMax comes in.  SoftMax is used as the activation function for output layers in **_multiclass classification problems_**.  To accomplish this, SoftMax outputs a _vector of probabilities_, where each number in the vector corresponds to the how likely it is that the input belongs to each corresponding class.  For instance, let's say we assigned an integer label to each flower type in the Iris dataset, with `setosa = 0`, `versicolor = 1`, and `virginica = 2`.  If, for a given example, the SoftMax output a vector with the values `[0.07, 0.89, 0.04]`, then we could interpret that as the neural network predicting a 7% chance that the flower is a setosa, 89% chance the flower is a versicolor, and 4% chance that the flower is a virginica.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**_Note:_**  You may have noticed that in the example above, the 3 probabilities within the vector output by the SoftMax add up to exactly 1.  This is no accident.  As long as we make sure that the output layer contains the same number of neurons as the number of total classes we are trying to predict, the vector will contain a probability for every possible class, and the sum of all the probabilities will aways be exactly 1.  \n",
