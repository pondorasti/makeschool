    "This notebook consists of a Convolutional Neural Network written in Keras, trained on the CIFAR10 dataset.  I'll add some basic information at each step to cover all the salient points of the model/dataset/process. \n",

    "\n",
    "<center><h3>The Dataset</h3></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "**_CIFAR10_** is a subset of the Tiny Images dataset containing 10 classes of images labeled images.  All images are 32 x 32 x 3 (meaning the image is in color, as opposed to black and white). There are a total of 60000 images in the dataset, meaning 6000 images per class. This is considered a harder image classification challenge than an introductory dataset such as MNIST because of the increased dimensionality that comes with 3 color channels and a slightly larger size.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><h3>Tools Used</h3></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to build this in **_Keras_** because the Keras API makes it incredibly easy to build prototypes.  With Keras, we get all of the benefits of Tensorflow under the hood, but without the boilerplate and overhead of pure Tensorflow (As of TF 1.5, Eager Execution is now available as a feature--I suspect that as this gains traction, complaints about Tensorflow boilerplate and setup overhead will become a thing of the past).  Keras contains great open-source implementations of all the layers needed to solve this problem, which allows us to define the architecture of our CNN with only one or two lines per layer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As an added benefit, Keras and Tensorflow both include _CIFAR10_ as one of their pre-packaged datasets for benchmarking model performance, so getting our data is also easy.  Aside from Keras, the only other tool used is Matplotlib, which is only used once for visualizing what an instance of our dataset actually looks like. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><h3>Model Architecture</h3></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this model, I chose to use a Convolutional Neural Network.  Here's a little bit about each layer used in the model, and what they are used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Convolutional Layers_**: Convolutional layers are the workhorse of CNNs, which explains the name. Convolutional Neural Networks are the considered the classic approach to image classification.  Although it's technically possible to build an image classifier using only Dense layers, a traditional Deep Neural Network would take orders of magnitude more data without the benefits of the feature maps created by the Convolutional Layers.  The main benefit of convolutional layers is that they reduce the dimensionality of of the data while mostly preserving the important information.  In this model, I use 4 Convolutional layers, with a MaxPooling2d layer after every 2 Conv2D layers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**_MaxPooling Layers_**: Pooling Layers are generally always used after Convolutional Layers to further reduce dimensionality.  MaxPooling is generally used, but AvgPooling is an option.  This layer looks at the feature map output by the layer before it in 2 x 2 blocks, and replaces the 2 x 2 block with the highest value contained within the block.  For instance, a MaxPooling2D layer would replace the 2x2 window `[[10, 7], [-4, 3]]` with the value `10`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**_Dense_**: Dense layers are the bread and butter of Neural Networks.  These are just regular fully-connected layers, where the inputs for every neuron are the outputs from every neuron in the previous layer, along with a vector of weights corresponding to how heavily the neuron weights each output from the neuron that sent it.  In practice, these are just vectora of weights which correspond to a vector of outputs, to make the math simpler.  The neuron computes the dot product of the weight vector and output vector, adds a bias (this is randomly initialized and learned, just like the weights), and then feeds this value (usually denoted as _z_) through the chosen activation function.  The output of the activation function is then passed as input to every neuron in the following layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Activation_**: This adds an activation function to feed the data through.  In computer vision, **_Rectified Linear Units (ReLU)_** are--by far--the most effective activation functions. ReLU outputs 0 for any negative value, but leaves any non-negative values alone.  See the graph below for a visual explanation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last layer, we use a **_Softmax_** activation function.  This function outputs a vector the shape of our labels, with each value in the vector corresponding to the percentage chance the model gives the data of being the corresponding class at that label.  The model then classifies the data as the class in the softmax output with the highest probability value.  Importantly, the sum of all values in a vector output by a softmax function will always be 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<center>Example Softmax Output: `[0.02, 0.0017, 0.96, ..., 0.001]`</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>Example Label Mappings: `[\"Dog\", \"Truck\", \"Airplane\", ..., \"Bird\"]`</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Flatten_**: This one is simple--it's just Keras's verison of `numpy.reshape`.  This reshapes n-dimensional arrays to a vector.  This is necessary when moving from Conv2D layers, which expect 2-dimensional arrays as inputs, to Dense layers, which expect 1-dimension vectors as inputs.  As a concrete example, a Flatten layer given a 28 x 28 array as input would output a vector of the shape (784, 1).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**_Dropout_**: Dropout layers are an effective form of regularization used in Deep Learning to prevent overfitting.  During training, the dropout layer \"turns off\" neurons in the previous layer, with the percentage chance of a neuron turning off being a tuneable hyperparameter passed in when the layer is created.  In this model, I've set a 25% dropout chance for neurons after the MaxPooling2D layers, and a 50% dropout chance after the Dense layers.  For a good intuition behind why dropout is effective, picture a sports team where one player is a superstar, and the coach's only objective is in winning. If the coach always relies on the superstar to do all the work, the other players (neurons) won't get much practice, and so won't learn to become better.  With dropout, there's a 50% chance the superstar neurons are turned off, giving the other neurons more practice (and more opportunities to make mistakes, which means more weight correction during the back propagation step).  Dropout layers are only used during the training step--they are turned off during testing.\n",

This is accomplished by padding the image with extra pixels with values of 0.  \n",

However, we don't include the first element, because that number corresponds to how many images are in our training set, not the shape of each image.
