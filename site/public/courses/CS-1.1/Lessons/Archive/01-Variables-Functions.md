# Variables and Functions

## Overview

We'll start by getting to know each other and understanding the scope of this course.  Then we'll jump into using pseudocode to break down a problem into programmable steps.  You'll be hands on with coding in tutorials and get a chance to present your Atom skills to the class.

### Why you should know this (optional)

By starting with a broad overview of the entire class you can understand what you already know and how what you will progress through the course.

## Learning Objectives/Competencies

1. Explore Core Programming concepts and be able to broadly define them.
1. Break down a problem into programmable steps and write in pseudocode.
1. Understand how to work with user stories and requirements.
1. Understand how to get input and display output in python.
1. Implement a simple python program using variables, functions and lists.

## Initial Exercise (10 min)

- Group introduction exercise.  Choose a programming concept from the white board (or add if it's not there), write it on a sticky note, and use it to introduce yourself. Get creative.

## Course Overview (10 min)
### Policies
- Participation
- Turning in assignments
- Notification if late / not attending

### How to Succeed in this Course
Make School courses are primarily hands on.  Your instructor will introduce a topic, help set context, build motivation and curiosity; but it's up to you to study concepts and practice coding until you master a topic.
- If a tutorial mentions "Learn more about lists" - you should read the documentation on lists, build sample programs to practice learning lists, quiz yourself on list concepts and overall become a master of lists.
- If a concept explained in class is not clear, you should dig into it after class.  Look for online explanations, ask your peers, build sample programs, ask your TA, slack your instructor.  Come to the next class an expert in this concept.

## Program Design Overview (10 min)
- Every program can be broken down into input, output and processing.  In order to perform the processing, you need fundamental programming concepts.
- Have the class choose a program example (ie Facebook). On the white board instructor breaks it down into input, output and processing. With class help, label the core concepts.  Illustrate how these concepts build into a program.

## Learn Python Overview (10 min)
- To learn a new language, start by learning how it implements core computer science fundamentals.
    - [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html)
- Then understand best practices and optimizations available in that language.
- Compare each language to others you know and understand the pros and cons of the language.

## In Class Activity: Program Design (40 min)
Design a program.
- Group activity (4 per group).
- Choose a problem statement.  On a white board, write the statement (2 to 3 sentences) and then write the pseudocode for the program to solve this problem.
    - Start with input, output, and processing.
    - Expand processing section details.
    - Label programming concepts.

## Variables and Functions Overview (20 min)
The most basic program uses variables to store input.
- Each variable has a dynamic data type based on the value assigned to it (string, int, float).
- All data types are Objects in Python, but some are immutable.
- Variable names should be meaningful to the context of the data they store.

We can process input information by performing operations on the variables.
- Basic operations include mathematical and string manipulation.
- When variables of different types are operated on the end result is cast to one of the types.

We can use functions to encapsulate parts of our program and make it accessible to re-use from other parts of our program and make it easier for a human reader to understand.
- Functions are defined once and can be called multiple times.
- Since everything is an object in Python, when you pass an argument to a function parameter it uses the "pass by object" protocol instead of either "pass by reference" or "pass by value". This means the reference to the object is what is passed but immutable objects remain immutable while other objects can be modified in the body of the function.

## In Class Activity: Start Programming! (10 min)
- Work on the tutorial.
- Ask you neighbor if you get stuck. Make sure to use proper programming terminology in your question.  (ex: Replace "this thing-ey" with "this parameter|object|function").
- Use Python Documentation.

## After Class

- Finish Captain Rainbow Tutorial
