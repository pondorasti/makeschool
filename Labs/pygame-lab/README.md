# Pygame Lab

This is the starter code used in the [Intensive 1 Pygame Lab](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18rlJz5q78frWXSEdH5cXDFJAdL1CZTz02tm3hleWIz4/edit?usp=sharing).

## Install Pygame

You can install Pygame with the command:

```
pip3 install pygame
```

If you don't yet have the SDL dependency, you may also need to run:

```
brew install sdl
```

## Hello, Pygame

Run the first "game" with the command:

```
python3 hello_pygame.py
```

## My First Interactive Game

Run the interactive game with the command:

```
python3 game.py
```

Then, complete the TODOs to add an "enemy" character (red square) that will reset points to 0 if it collides with the player.
