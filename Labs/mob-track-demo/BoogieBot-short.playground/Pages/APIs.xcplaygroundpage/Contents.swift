## APIs
 
 App developers always depend on code written by others. In the case of BoogieBot, a number of functions are defined that make BoogieBot start, move, and change colors.
 
 The set of functions that control BoogieBot is an example of an _Application Programming Interface_, more commonly known as an _API_.
 
 An API is a specific set of functionality that a software developer can use to accomplish a task. In this case, the BoogieBot API is making a software robot dance.

### BoogieBot API
 Start BoogieBot:
- `startBot()`
 
 Move BoogieBot:
 
- `leftArmUp()`, `leftArmDown()`, `rightArmUp()`, `rightArmDown()`
- `leftLegUp()`, `leftLegDown()`, `rightLegUp()`, `rightLegDown()`
- `shakeItLeft()`, `shakeItRight()`, `shakeItCenter()`
- `jumpUp()`, `jumpDown()`
 
 Change BoogieBot color:
- `fabulize()`, `defabulize()`
 
 Next, learn how to put these functions together to make dance routines.
