## BoogieBot
 
 In this playground you’ll get to know BoogieBot, a dancing robot.
 
 You’ll make BoogieBot dance by calling functions. Then you’ll define functions of your own to create dance routines.
 
 Finally, you’ll add a text title, sign your work, and save it as an animated image like the one below:

 You'll see briefly some Swift syntax on how to use functions. Swift is the programming languague used to create iOS apps.
 
 Next, find out how to configure your playground so it's ready to see some dancing.
