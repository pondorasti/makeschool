    /* In this example you will need to write the selectors yourself! */

    /* Style the list use the selector: ul { ... your styles here... } */
    /* Remove the bullet list-style none */
      

    /* Style the blockquote: blockquote { ... } */
    /* make the font large 2em */
    /* Set the font to a serif use Gerogia */
    /* Needs some line height 1.5 */
      
    /* Here are some new selectors */

    /* Even numbered list items */
    li:nth-child(even) {
      /* Set the color #775 */
      
      /* Align the text to the right */
      
    }

    /* These style will use some advanced selectors. */
    /* You in this case you need to select only the */
    /* odd numbered list items */
    li:nth-child(odd) {
      /* Set the color #757 */
      
      /* Align the text to the left */
      
    }
  
    /* Style the first letter */
    blockquote::first-letter {
      /* Set the color #000 */
      
      /* Try changing the font size */

    }
  
    /* Here you need to style the authors name. */
    /* The name is in a footer tag that is inside a blockquote. */
    /* If you use footer as the selector it would also affect the */
    /* the footer at the top of the page. To solve this use  */
    /* blockqoute footer { ... } This selector will only target */
    /* footer tags that exist inside a blockquote */
    
    /* Style the author */
    blockquote footer {
      /* Make the font smaller 0.5em */
      
      /* Make the font weight bold */
      
      /* Change the color #666 */
      
    }

    /* Now style the footer at the bottom of the page */
    /* This footer is a child of main. Use this selector: */
    /* main > footer */
    main > footer {
      /* text align center */
      
    }

    /* Stretch Challenges
      
      - Adjust the colors. 
      - Swap the alignment. Currently the even list items are on the 
      left and the odd numbered items are on the right. Swap these. 
      - Choose some different fonts. The example currently uses Georgia. 
      - Adjust the style of the author's name. Your goal is to make the 
      legible but have a style that makes it clear that it's associated
      with the quote but not part of quoted text itself.
