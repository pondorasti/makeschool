# MongoDB & Testing Starter Code

In today's class, we will explore 1) persisting data with MongoDB, and 2) writing tests using mocks.

## How to Use This Code

Make sure you have installed Flask and MongoDB.

Open a new terminal window and run:

```bash
$ mongod
```

Then, you can run your application with:

```bash
$ flask run
```

Run the tests with:

```bash
$ python3 tests.py
```
