# Debugging Techniques Lab

You've been hired as a software engineer at a new company. Their previous engineer quit unexpectedly, and left some code that... isn't exactly production-ready.

For each of the following 3 exercises, your job is to use the techniques covered in class to locate and find the bug(s). 

## Exercise 1 - Flask Pizza Shop

The first exercise is a pizza shop written in Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy. It should be partially working - the previous engineer left it in a good enough state that you can see a homepage and a "New Order" page. However, new pizzas aren't being added to the homepage, and customers are waiting at the door to place their orders!

**As you debug, write down the steps you take in `debug_log.md`.** You'll submit this as your homework assignment.

**Your job is to get the "New Order" page in working order**, so that new pizza orders are displayed correctly on the homepage. Make sure to watch out for multiple bugs!

## Exercise 2 - Weather API

The second exercise is a Flask application that tells you what the weather is in your city. The first page should be functional, but once you click the submit button, there are a few bugs to work out.

**As you debug, write down the steps you take in `debug_log.md`.** You'll submit this as your homework assignment.

**Your job is to get the Results page in working order**, so that it correctly shows the weather in the user's city and uses the given units of measurement. Make sure to watch out for multiple bugs!

## Exercise 3 - Searching/Sorting

The third exercise contains a searching & sorting algorithm. The `main.py` file contains some test code that isn't quite working yet. **If you can, try to solve this one without looking up solutions to the algorithms.** 

**As you debug, write down the steps you take in `debug_log.md`.** You'll submit this as your homework assignment.

**Your job is to get the `merge_sort` and `binary_search` functions in working order**, so that they correctly compute the sorted list and the index of the given element. Make sure to watch out for multiple bugs!

## Submission

You will need to submit `debug_log.md` to Gradescope as your homework.
