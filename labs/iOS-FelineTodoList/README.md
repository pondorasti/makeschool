# iOS-FelineTodoList

## CODING EXERCISE:

One of the potential benefits of the **Model-View-ViewModel (MMVM)** design pattern is its ability to resolve the __*"Massive-View-Controller Problem"*__ by focusing `View Controllers` to their intended purpose: Responding to `View` lifecycle events.

Your task in this exercise is to apply this principle of MVVM to the `Viewcontroller` in the starter app by rededicating it to only its originally intended purpose.

### TIPS:

  - Follow the `//TODO:` comments -- they are there to guide you...
  
### Required Resources:

1. This `FelineTaskList4` starter app. Current state of app is:

- To guide you in refactoring the app, a couple of new files have been added (e.g., `DataSource`, `TodoListViewModel`), but __*they are incomplete.*__

- Because those files are incomplete, the __*app will not run__* until refactoring has been successfully completed.

- Once successfully completed, the table view presented in the app will look like the screenshot below:
