# PART 1: Gather Information

# TODO: Gather information about the source of the error and paste your findings here. E.g.:
# - What is the expected vs. the actual output?
# - What error message (if any) is there?
# - What line number is causing the error?
# - What can you deduce about the cause of the error?


# PART 2: State Assumptions
#
# TODO: State your assumptions here or say them out loud to your partner ...
# Make sure to be SPECIFIC about what each of your assumptions is!
