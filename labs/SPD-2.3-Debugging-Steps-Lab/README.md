# Debugging Exercises

## Part 1: Gather Information

For each of the exercises, run the code and **gather as much information as you can** about the source of the error, based on the code's output. For example, you may want to answer the questions:

- What is the expected vs. the actual output?
- What error message (if any) is there?
- What line number is causing the error?
- What can you deduce about the cause of the error?

**You don't actually need to find and fix the error yet!** We'll do that in the next step.

If you have trouble with this part, you can check out `example.py` to see how to do it.

## Part 2: State Assumptions

For each of the exercises, read over the code line-by-line with a partner. For each line of code, **state any assumptions you have** about how the code behaves. E.g. "the `i` variable is set to the index of the next element." For each assumption, **add a print statement** to the code to verify that your assumption is accurate. E.g. you can print out the `i` variable and check its value(s) against what you expect.

## Submission Instructions

After you finish the exercises, submit your code on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/206382/assignments/949586/) under "Homework 1: Debugging Steps Lab". Your instructor will grade your work based on completion.
