## In Class Activities

- *Design a User Interview Script* - Students are required to create a "User Interview Script" that they will eventually use to conducting actual user interviews. While the PEST Analysis and Competitive Analysis give us a macro view of a problem space, User Interviews help us see the problem from a new perspective - through the eyes people experiencing it. Together, both forms of analysis enable us to understand the nuance of the problem. You can find User interview best practices in these [class slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xtUGbErF315eKkvVAstTnWzoXLmpygtf6YGTEMYwg_A/edit#slide=id.g3435adb14f_0_1), this [Sample User Interview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uRRKejC3Ullk5vdw9P1SHmE56CGkekH2dIaoBV9ISeM/edit), and this article to ensure you have [unbiased questions](https://surveytown.com/10-examples-of-biased-survey-questions/). Assignment will be given in class.
