        Here is where interesting thing start to happen.

        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.

        Positioning information is passed through data attributes.

        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element
        with `data-x="-1000"`
        and `data-y="-1500"` attributes. This means that **the center** of the
        element (yes, the center)
        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation
        'canvas'.

        It will not be rotated or scaled.

        <h1>Drawing with Sketch</h1>

    <!-- Design -->
    <div id="design" class="step" data-x="4000" data-y="0">
        <h1>Design a login screen with Sketch</h1>
    </div>

    <!-- Forms -->
    <div id="forms" class="step" data-x="6000" data-y="0">
        <h1>Forms and form elements in HTML</h1>
    </div>

    <!-- Create a form -->
    <div id="create" class="step" data-x="8000" data-y="0">
        <h1>Create a form</h1>
    </div>

    <!-- Your Form -->
    <div id="your-form" class="step" data-x="10000" data-y="0">
        <h1>Create your form</h1>
    </div>

    <!--  -->

    <!--

        And now it gets really exciting! We move into third dimension!

        Along with `data-x` and `data-y`, you can define the position on third (Z) axis, with
        `data-z`. In the example below we use `data-z="-3000"` meaning that element should be
        positioned far away from us (by 3000px).

        This step here doesn't introduce anything new when it comes to data attributes, but you
        should notice in the demo that some words of this text are being animated.
        It's a very basic CSS transition that is applied to the elements when this step element is
        reached.

        At the very beginning of the presentation all step elements are given the class of `future`.
        It means that they haven't been visited yet.

        When the presentation moves to given step `future` is changed to `present` class name.
        That's how animation on this step works - text moves when the step has `present` class.

        Finally when the step is left the `present` class is removed from the element and `past`
        class is added.

        So basically every step element has one of three classes: `future`, `present` and `past`.
        Only one current step has the `present` class.

    -->


    <!--

        So to summarize of all the possible attributes used to position presentation steps, we have:

        * `data-x`, `data-y`, `data-z` - they define the position of **the center** of step element on
            the canvas in pixels; their default value is 0;
        * `data-rotate-x`, `data-rotate-y`, 'data-rotate-z`, `data-rotate` - they define the rotation of
            the element around given axis in degrees; their default value is 0; `data-rotate` and `data-rotate-z`
            are exactly the same;
        * `data-scale` - defines the scale of step element; default value is 1

        These values are used by impress.js in CSS transformation functions, so for more information consult
        CSS transfrom docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/transform

    Hint is not related to impress.js in any way.

    But it can show you how to use impress.js features in creative way.

    When the presentation step is shown (selected) its element gets the class of "active" and the body element
    gets the class based on active step id `impress-on-ID` (where ID is the step's id)... It may not be
    so clear because of all these "ids" in previous sentence, so for example when the first step (the one with
    the id of `bored`) is active, body element gets a class of `impress-on-bored`.

    This class is used by this hint below. Check CSS file to see how it's shown with delayed CSS animation when
    the first step of presentation is visible for a couple of seconds.

    ...

    And when it comes to this piece of JavaScript below ... kids, don't do this at home ;)
    It's just a quick and dirty workaround to get different hint text for touch devices.
    In a real world it should be at least placed in separate JS file ... and the touch content should be
    probably just hidden somewhere in HTML - not hard-coded in the script.

    Just sayin' ;)

<div class="hint">
    <p>Use a spacebar or arrow keys to navigate</p>
</div>
<script>
if ("ontouchstart" in document.documentElement) {
    document.querySelector(".hint").innerHTML = "<p>Tap on the left or right to navigate</p>";
}
</script>
<script src="js/impress.js"></script>
<script>impress().init();</script>

<!--

    The `impress()` function also gives you access to the API that controls the presentation.

    Just store the result of the call:

        var api = impress();

    and you will get three functions you can call:

        `api.init()` - initializes the presentation,
        `api.next()` - moves to next step of the presentation,
        `api.prev()` - moves to previous step of the presentation,
        `api.goto( stepIndex | stepElementId | stepElement, [duration] )` - moves the presentation to the step given by its index number
                id or the DOM element; second parameter can be used to define duration of the transition in ms,
                but it's optional - if not provided default transition duration for the presentation will be used.

    You can also simply call `impress()` again to get the API, so `impress().next()` is also allowed.
    Don't worry, it wont initialize the presentation again.

    For some example uses of this API check the last part of the source of impress.js where the API
    is used in event handlers.
