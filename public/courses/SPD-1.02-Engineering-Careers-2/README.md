## Class Assignments

### Answering Behavioral Interview Questions (OPTIONAL!)

**3 answers due: Wed, July 17**

**5 additional answers due: Wed, July 24**

As you go through the interview process, you will encounter the same (or similar) behavioral interview questions in most interviews you take. It's good to have answers to common questions primed and ready to go so you can have examples and stories to share at hand that highlight your skillset and talents.

### Code Reviews (2 total)

**Due: Wed, July 31st**

Do a code review for two different peers (**two total code reviews**). Ask them for a codebase with substantial code - i.e. intensive project or projects at the harder end of difficulty for the developer.

**Submission**

1. Read through the [code review rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19m8J8I5ZT66m5x1Q87yr6-CDg_jxBNCVd_a4fSq1xiw/edit?usp=sharing) for guidance on how to give feedback 
1. Open an issue on the GitHub Repo for the code you are reviewing: Click on the `Issues` tab, and then click the `New Issue` button
1. Provide your feedback in the issue. Include code snippets from their project to specifically highlight what you would change/improve
1. At the top of the code review, list the [code review rubric row topics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19m8J8I5ZT66m5x1Q87yr6-CDg_jxBNCVd_a4fSq1xiw/edit?usp=sharing) you address in the code review (i.e. Readability & Formatting, Testing & Error Handling, etc.)
1. Put the link to your opened issue in the progress tracker

**Evaluation:**

To pass the code review assignments, you as the reviewer must provide feedback on 4/6 row topics as listed in the [code review rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19m8J8I5ZT66m5x1Q87yr6-CDg_jxBNCVd_a4fSq1xiw/edit?usp=sharing)

### Take Home Coding Project

**Due: Fri, August 2nd**

A common interview practice is to assign a take home project for the interviee to complete. You're typically given a prompt or spec to follow, and a deliverable date or timeline. Through this assignment, our goal is to give you practice with a take home project with the same conditions you'd find in a real interview scenario.

[Here are the requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F3LByW-A1pSpviBL4g3u9VMVuoUjxi1dUmOC_Sczg2U/edit) for the take home interview project (July 31st). 

### Pair Programming Sessions (2 total)

**Due: Wed, August 7th**

Do **two Pair Programing sessions with a peer on their project** (you’ll be the navigator, then switch to the driver). Both sessions can be with the same peer, or a different peer per sessoin. 

Context: Engineers at Facebook, Twitter, Square and countless other tech companies do pair programming. Your abilities as a future boss, PM, peer, and engineer teammate will be heightened through the skills you practice through this assignment. Your goal is to have your partner leave the session feeling empowered rather than discouraged. Use your knowledge from class (slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xs43CIsX56hMN3BBVR88zzaCvMqNT1mpFv_gH6z7_Wc/edit?usp=sharing) and [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nZnYIpEcNhNN71E122PnnVF-s3D85Fa9J1XU_7x0yE4/edit?usp=sharing); [pair programming agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19m8J8I5ZT66m5x1Q87yr6-CDg_jxBNCVd_a4fSq1xiw/edit?usp=sharing)) to help a peer level up.
