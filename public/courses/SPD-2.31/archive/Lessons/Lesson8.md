# Refactor Lab [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12y0AEspuBbNAl8MNZKmCf1HtNrxcSrSzPzbh-Ci8xso/edit?usp=sharing)

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this class, you should be able to…

1. Practice walking through a function in order to debug it
1. Write tests for your own projects to improve their resilience
1. Practice basic QA by trying to break projects

## Quiz

Review material from the Developer Testing class by taking the [quiz](http://make.sc/spd1.4-testing-quiz). We'll then go over the answers in class as a group

## Random Debug

Look over [this snippet](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12y0AEspuBbNAl8MNZKmCf1HtNrxcSrSzPzbh-Ci8xso/edit#slide=id.g568fd68b79_0_0) of Python 3 code. How many things can you find wrong with it?

Practice with a partner whiteboarding your thought process and explaining your reasoning. We'll later go over the solution as a class.

## Test Brainstorm

Get in pairs, and then you each have 10 minutes each to do the following:

1. Present your project, as well as a high-level overview of the codebase (i.e. a technical review)
1. Discuss as a pair what tests should be added to cover the following cases:
    1. Good Input
    1. Bad Input
    1. Expected results (success cases)
    1. Unexpected results (error cases)
    1. Edge Cases
1. Use any extra time to write tests for your project. Remember you’re trying to reinforce it before your peers try to break it!

## Testing Games

1. Make sure your live project from Column M in the tracker is easily accessible to anyone to test
1. For each project, spend 5-10 minutes trying to break it!
    1. Test the handling of good/bad input
    1. Try to find/exploit edge cases
    1. Try to cause errors!
1. Provide feedback, then find a new partner! Aim for 4-5!
