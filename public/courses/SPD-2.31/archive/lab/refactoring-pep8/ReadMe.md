# Lab: Refactoring Code to Comply with PEP 8 (Style Guide for Python)

In this series of exercises, we learn how to refactor code for better readiblity according to PEP 8 guidelines.

## Activity 1: Indentation

Consider the following guidelines:

- Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- Maximum line length is 79 characters.
- Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces, or using a hanging indent. Refer to class slides for visual explanation.

Now, Study the file 'indentation2.py' and fix all indentation issues.

## Activity 2: Whitespaces and Naming Convention

Fix all whitespace and naming convention issues of the file "whitespace_naming_convention2.py".

## Activity 3: Docstrings

Add necessary docstrings to the file "docstrings_blank_lines.py". Fix any other issues discussed in this document (if you find any).
