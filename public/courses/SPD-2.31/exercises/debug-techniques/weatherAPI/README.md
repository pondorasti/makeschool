# Weather API
The second exercise is a Flask application that tells you what the weather is in your city. The first page should be functional, but once you click the submit button, there are a few bugs to work out.

## Usage
To run the code, open a terminal and navigate to the `weatherAPI` folder, then run:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then to run the server:

```
python3 app.py
```
