# Refactoring Lab: PEP 8 (Style Guide for Python)

In this series of exercises, we learn how to refactor code for better readability according to PEP 8 guidelines.

## TODO
- [ ] Activity 1: Fix Indentation  [indentation.py](indentation.py)  
 
    Consider the following guidelines:
    - Use `4 spaces` per indentation level.
    - Maximum line length is `79 characters`.
    - Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces, or using a hanging indent. Refer to class slides for visual explanation.

- [ ] Activity 2: Fix Whitespaces and Naming Convention [whitespace_naming_convention.py](whitespace_naming_convention.py)


- [ ] Activity 3: Add Docstrings [docstrings_blank_lines.py](docstrings_blank_lines.py) 
  - Fix any other issues discussed in this document (if you find any).
