## Class 3: Probability & Sampling

### Activities
- Compare code quality for getting random dictionary words
- Refactor code to improve readability, modularity, and performance
- Compare tradeoffs of different histogram implementations
- Lecture and discussion following [probability and sampling slides]

### Objectives
After completing this class session and the associated tutorial challenges, students will be able to ...
- Sample words according to their observed frequencies
- Compare tradeoffs with different sampling techniques
- Validate sampling techniques based on relative probabilities

### Challenges
These challenges are the baseline required to complete the project and course.
Be sure to complete these before next class session and before starting on the stretch challenges below.
- [Page 4: Stochastic Sampling]
    - Sample words by observed frequency weighting
    - Test relative probabilities to validate sampling technique

### Stretch Challenges
These challenges are more difficult and help you push your skills and understanding to the next level.
- [Page 4: Stochastic Sampling]
    - Optimize for speed of sampling (read time)
    - Optimize for memory (use the least amount of space)
    - Solve with only lists and tuples
    - Combine other weighting techniques

### Resources
- Review Make School's [probability and sampling slides]
- Consult Python's [random module] documentation, but *do not* use the `random.choices` function (the challenge is to implement this yourself)
- If you're *really* stuck, read the Python Cookbook's [Randomly Picking Items with Given Probabilities], but *don't read this until you've tried to solve it yourself*
