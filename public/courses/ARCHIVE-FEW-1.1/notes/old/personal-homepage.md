# Personal Homepage Project

The goal of this project is to create your own personal homepage. Your personal homepage can be anything you envision. 

Try to limit yourself to the only frontend for now. 
You can add backend features in the future. 
ideally, this would be a playground or platform where you can practice the material from class. 

You will have time to work this project in class. You can also work on it outside of class. 

## What is your personal homepage?

This is a platform to be your presence on the internet. Use it to display your work and accomplishments. 

Content might contain any of these following:

- Information about you
- Experimental lab
  - Show your CSS and JS experiments
- Links and descriptions for your projects
- Blog 
  - You can mock up the backend for now and make functional in the future. 
- CS code samples with your thoughts and opinions
- Anything else you can think of...

This can be any project you want it to be. 
Keeping some limits will allow you to get more out of the project. 

The class is focussed on the frontend. Limit yourself to only frontend features. Keep in mind you can expand the project in the future. 

## Check your work

Use this guide for creating your personal home page. 

Your goal is to use all of the material from class in one place.

If you feel that you need more of a challenge talk to me and I can help you find areas where you can apply your skills.

Do your best to address each of the items on the list below.

- Style your work
  - Use *three* levels of hierarchy
  - Font styles strive for legibility
    - Set the font-size on the *body* element in px
    - Set the font size of *other elements* in em
    - Set the color. 
    - You can use different font-family for headings.
    - Use *line-height* to set the line spacing (this helps legibility)
    - Text should *not* touch an edge (You probably need padding on the parent)
    - Try to get three levels of *hierarchy*.
    - *Use flex box* to arrange things in vertical or horizontal groups
- Code review with another student
  - HTML: Check semantics and usage
    - Check the comments and formatting
    - Look at your tag choices an ask yourself about its relevance
      - Does that content really deserve an h1 or article tag?
    - Check the usage (be sure to consult the documentation for the tag!)
      - Is that `li` inside a `ul` or `ol`?
      - Do your sections have headings?
      - Did you use all of the correct attributes?
    - Check your work with the validator!
    - https://validator.w3.org
  - CSS: Check syntax and style rules.
    - Style and formatting
      - Follow the style guide: https://github.com/airbnb/css
    - Did you use comments?
      - Whether you feel you need them or not annotating your work is professional!
