# JavaScript API

Modern browsers are very sophisticated applications that are almost an operating system to themselves. All of this functionality is accessible through JavaScript. 

People are making advanced and highly functional applications that run in the browser. 

## Learning Objectives

1. Name and identify JavaScript APIs in the browser
1. Explore and identify upcoming technologies available in the browser
1. Measure browser support for any feature
1. Review Personal Websites

## Personal Home Page Review

Show your work in class. 

1. Provide some background
    - Why did you make this? 
    - What are your goals with the assignment? 
1. Show your site
2. Show your code
    - Show a section of your code
    - Explain the problems you overcame and your solutions

## Browser API Project

This a list of browser APIs that I compiled. It's not in any kind of order. Some of the APIs below are well established and in use today, some are in experimental status and may be in full use or be replaced in the future. For this assignment, you can use any of these or others you might discover that is not on this list. 

The first half of the list covers as many JavaScript-based APIs as I could find. The second half of the list covers CSS features. You can use either. If it's something we covered in class I expect you to go beyond what was covered in class!

You are not limited to this list. You can choose other browser features that you might discover. The only requirement is that the feature or API you choose is one that is implemented in the browser!

For APIs that are experimental be sure to look up their support and include this as part of your assignment. 

- Gauge browser support: https://caniuse.com 

"Can I Use" has a lot of features. You can gauge support by the browser, region, device etc. It also shows historical data. Be sure to mine this for your feature and include as much of this as you find relevant. 

## Overview

The browser API determines what you can do with the browser. There are many amazing apps that run in the browser.  Below is a short list of applications that run in the browser and make use of new features or push the standard features to their limit.

## In Class Activity I

- Discussion
  - What are the limitations of applications that run in a web browser? 
  - What are the advantages of applications that run in a web browser?

## After Class

Begin working on the [Browser API Project](javascript-api-project.md). Refer to the project description document and this class for details about the project.
