# API Project 

The goal this week is to create a project with React that comsumes an 
API. Keep this first project simple. You need only display data from 
your API with minimal input. 

Examples: 

- Weather App
- Heartherstone Card search
- Text Translation

Keep your initial app simple. Add more features after getting the 
basic features working. 

## Find an API to work with

Find an API to work with. Choose something simple for the focus of this
project. You can add more features later. 

- [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com)
- [Programable Web](https://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory)
- [API List](https://apilist.fun)
- [Any API](https://any-api.com)

## Create React App

Use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) 
to create a React starter project. 

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

## React Patterns: input

React has some patterns that are very specific to React. Input for form 
elements is one of these. 

The pattern requires a stateful component. The idea is to hold the 
current value of form elements on state while updating the value of 
the form element to the value stored in state. 

The pattern is to set state when onChange and update the value of the 
element when state changes.

## Project 

Your project should meet these requirements

- Built with React 
- Consumes an API 
  - Requests data from an API 
  - Displays data in response from API
