## GraphQL

Learn GraphQL the better replacement for REST! Invented at Facebook to solve problems imposed by REST. GraphQL is an open source alternative that offers a new way of managing network resources. 

### Why you should know this (optional)

GraphQL provides many advantages over REST. It's used by all of the biggest services. 

FaceBook, Coursera, GitHub and many others 

GraphQL is built with a schema and strong types. GraphQL provides reliablity through it's strong typing system. GraphQL provides a solution to over fetching and unders fetching data, and allows front end requests to determine what data is returned from an endpoint.

## Evaluation
To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Complete all required tutorials 
- Pass all projects according to the associated project rubric
- Pass the final summative assessment >=75%
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy

## Attendance
Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
