# CS 2.2 Advanced Recursion and Graphs

This course covers graph theory, data structures, algorithms, and analysis. Key concepts include graph traversals, pathfinding, recursion, greedy algorithms, memoization and dynamic programming. Students will build an original project whose underlying structure requires the use of graph structures and algorithms to solve real-world problems such as airplane routing, social networking, and board games.

Graphs can be used to model and solve a wide variety of problems, including systems of roads, airline flights from city to city, how the Internet is connected, or even the sequence of classes you must take to complete your degree here at Make School! Understanding graphs allows you to build models of these problems and use those models to find optimal or best case solutions.

## Class Work

### Assignments

### Coding Modules

Each lesson will have an associated module consisting of review, conceptual, and coding activities as well as interview prep related to the topic. At the end of each week you will turn your module work into gradescope for feedback and a score.

### Final Project

Students will also create a [final project] applying and implementing an advanced graph related topic

## Assignment Submissions

We will be using [Gradescope](gradescope.com), which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. *All assigned work will be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope.*

As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your Gradescope login is your Make School email, and your password can be changed at [https://gradescope.com/reset_password](https://gradescope.com/reset_password). The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.

## Academic Honesty Policy

At Make School, we highly encourage collaboration between students on assignments. Working with other people is the best way to learn!

However, there's a big difference between **collaboration** (writing code together with another person) and **plagiarism** (copying code from a classmate or outside source without providing proper attribution). 

Here are some guidelines to follow in order to avoid plagiarism:

1. If you are looking at an outside source for help, **close the window** containing the code before writing your own solution.
1. Do not write down a line of code unless you **completely understand** how it works. (This is true even if the source you're referencing is the lesson slides/examples/etc!)
1. If your code is still similar to an outside source or another student's, **provide attribution** by adding a comment to your code explaining where it was taken from.

We take academic honesty very seriously at Make School. The consequences for violating the policy are as follows:

- You will be required to write a [Self-Reflection Letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/140_PHfDh7gu33OZI_caxEtvNzAlAepjnGcbQcXZ-MRo/edit?usp=sharing) to reflect on how your actions affected others.
- If this is your first offense, you may be permitted to redo the assignment for a reduced grade (at the instructor's discretion).
- The incident will be added to your permanent record at Make School and you may be placed on a Participation Improvement Plan (PIP).

For subsequent offenses, more serious consequences may be considered. For more information, please see [Make School's academic honesty policy](https://make.sc/academic-honesty-policy).
