# Type Challenges 

Finding type that works together is not easy. With some effort you can find
type that adds value to your products. 

## Using type effectively

The key to using type effectively in your apps and web sites is using styles
to differentiate elements.

## Challenge 

__Font Pairs__

Your goal is to explore type by finding font pairs that work well together. 
Often your apps and web sites will use 

- Match two type faces that work together as heading and body. Do this for each of the following:
    - __Constrast:__ Find two fonts that contrast well. For example a heavy and a light type face. 
    - __Family:__ Find one type face with two or weights that combine well. 
    - __Style:__ Find two type faces with different styles that work well together. This could be a Serif and San Serif.
