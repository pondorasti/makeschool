# Visualizing with chartist

## Description
This project is dedicated towards demonstrating the use of plotting data dynamically with chartist.js.
All data is provided by a backend consisting of two routes:

1. Index route for fetching the index page
2. time series route for fetching the appropriate time series data

The backend is built and powered by flask & pandas. (python 3.7.3)

## Goals and Visions
1. To demonstrate using chartist.js for plotting data dynamically via a web application
2. Connect my data science, Frontend web, and Backend web skills together.

## How to run
To get started, download this repository and install all the pip requirements utilizing:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
python3 time_series_pandas_flask.py
```

to run the server which will allow you to access the application on port 5000 in debug mode
and port 3000 in production mode.
