# WEB 1.0 - Styles Part 1

## Description 

The goal of this assignment is to get started working with styles. You should be applying styles to your work and solving problems along the way. 

### Why this assignment?

CSS is how the web is styled! Everything you see on the web and much of what you see on mobile is styled with CSS. Better looking projects are adopted by more users and it's more satisfying as a deverloper to make something beautiful. 

## Goals

Your goal is to style your portfolio page. You will do this by adding a a style sheet and writing CSS.

Keep in mind that CSS is applied to elements on the page through selectors. Selectors target elements on the page either by an identifier: 

- tag name
- class name 
- id name 

Or by the DOM structure using selectors: descendent (`section h1`) or child (`section > h1`). Review your selectors here: [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io). You don't have to know all of these now, if you can master the first 9 you're doing great!

### Personal portfolio site

Use the CSS covered in class to style your portfolio page. Create a `styles.css` file to put your styles in. For now you only need to worrry about things covered in class, feel free to look up and explore new styles.

Make use of at least these style properties: 

- Typography
    - font-family
    - font-size
    - font-weight
    - color
- layout
    - flex
    - margin
    - padding
- background
    - background-color
    - border-color
    - border-width
    - border-style

If you're not sure how to apply these refer to the challenges in class and borrow ideas. 

### Deliverable

Submit your new portfolio site through Gradescope. Zip up your revised `index.html` and `index.css` files and submit the zip file in the appropriate assignment

### Due date

Class 4, Tue, Sept 1
