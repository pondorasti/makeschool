# Study Guide for MOB 1.2 Final Assessment<br>

*Overview:* Your final exam will focus on the learning outcomes for this course.  Review each outcome thoroughly and ask questions if you are unclear about the outcome or your level of understanding.

*Final Exam Format:* Written

**Outcome 1: Build an app using UIKit components including: UIViews, UIViewControllers, UITableViews, UICollectionViews and custom classes.**

Ways we learned about this in the course
- All of the course tutorials used UIKit for their graphical components either using storyboards or having them programmatically.
- Class on Custom Views, UITableViews and CollectionViews.
- In-class project covered all these topics.

Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
- Create UITableViews and UICollectionViews implementing datasource and delegate methods
- Instantiate UIViewControllers programmatically
- Create and handle .xib files
- Create a custom cell for UITableViews and UICollectionViews
- Identify how a compositional layout is built and how it changes with different values 


**Outcome 2: Apply AutoLayout to achieve a good distribution of elements in different screen sizes and orientations.**

Ways we learned about this in the course
- Classes AutoLayout
- Lab section on coding constraints programmatically

Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
- Knowing when to manipulate CHP & CCRP.
- Displaying elements in a UIStackView.
- Setting constraints programmatically.

**Outcome 3: Implement MVC and understand the separation of concerns for each component.**

Ways we learned about this in the course
- Class covering MVC basics.
- In-Class project covered was structured using MVC.

Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
- Create models.
- Create custom views such as cells.
- Know how to reference the model and the views from the controller.
- Know what each component is responsible for.

**Outcome 4: Pass information between view controllers & handling navigation.**

Ways we learned about this in the course
- Class covering navigation & passing information
- Class covering tab bar controller
- Bot Shop tutorial used a tab bar 

Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
- Navigating programmatically, using different animations (present, push, dismiss, pop).
- Implement a tab bar controller in combination with navigation controllers.


There will be an optional coding section.

- Mostly for practice, it's recommended that you try it out. 
- Any points you get in that section will be extra points added to the overall test score.
