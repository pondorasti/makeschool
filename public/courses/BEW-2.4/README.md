## Course Description

In this course, students will learn how to utilize a fresh, exciting new development paradigm that harnesses the power of peer-to-peer applications and distributed architectures. This course begins by demystifying common jargon in the modern-day blockchain ecosystem, then establishes best practices for developing consensus based products and services.

Students will learn how to write smart contracts, tokens, and other cryptographic assets using smart contracts written in Solidity --- quickly enabling each student to invent and produce the decentralized holdings of their dreams!

## Prerequisites

- [BEW 1.3](https://make.sc/bew1.3)
- [CS 1.3](https://make.sc/cs1.3)

## Course Specifics

**Course Delivery**: online | 7 weeks | 14 sessions<br>
**Course Credits**: 3 units | 37.5 Seat Hours | 75 Total Hours

## Learning Outcomes

**By the end of the course, you will be able to...**

1. Compare and contrast centralized and decentralized protocols, and determine the best use case for each technique.
1. Dive deeper into common decentralized protocols used daily by all developers.
1. Identify and describe different standards for token-based assets and their specific use cases on the blockchain.

## Class Assignments

### Tutorials

- **[CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io)** is an interactive school that teaches you all things technical about blockchains! Learn to make smart contracts in Solidity by making your own crypto-collectibles game.
  - You must choose the Solidity version of the tutorial. **DO NOT CHOOSE LIBRA**!
  - **Complete** the **Solidity Path** and the **Hands on Path**.
  - **_Plasma Path is optional._**

### Assignments

We will be using [Gradescope] this term, which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. All assigned work will be submitted through [Gradescope], and assignment and exam grades will be returned through [Gradescope]. As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your [Gradescope] login is your Make School email, and your password can be changed at [https://gradescope.com/reset_password](https://gradescope.com/reset_password). The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.

### Final Project

[MakeCoin Project]: Design and mint your very own [ERC-20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/er20)), [ERC-721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721), [ERC-777](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc777), or [ERC-1155](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc1155) assets, then use them in a custom, full-stack distributed application!

## Evaluation

**To pass this course you must meet the following requirements**:

- Complete all required [tutorials](#tutorials), [assignments](#assignments), and [projects](#final-project).
- Score `>36` points on the [MakeCoin Project], according to the [MakeCoin Rubric].
