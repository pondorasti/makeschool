## Learning Objectives/Competencies (5 Minutes)

1. Introduce high-level Ruby and Ruby on Rails concepts.
1. Define common syntactical Ruby features and idioms.
1. Present language syntax features to the class.

## Initial Exercise (15 Minutes)

- **Think, Pair, Share - Ruby Rumors**: _What have you heard about Ruby / Ruby on Rails?_

## Overview/TT (15 Minutes)

### TT: Setup Syntax Overview Activity

#### Activity

- Form students into 5 groups.
- Assign a Ruby syntax feature to each group:
  - Operators and Keywords
  - Variables (Instance, Global, and Types of Variables)
  - Methods (Class Methods, Method Arguments)
  - Blocks and Block Arguments (Closures, Iterators, Generators)
  - Arrays and Hashes
- Announce target presentation time: each group will be responsible for a **10 to 15 minute presentation with live code examples**.
- Each group will create a short slide deck describing the language feature they've been assigned.

## BREAK (10 Minutes)

## In Class Activity I (45 Minutes)

### Language Features

- Allow students the remainder of the time to work in groups and build their presentations.

## Wrap Up

- Synthesize the main points of presentations with the class.
- Remind students that presentations will start at the beginning of class.

## After Class

- Complete your syntax presentations with your group.
  - Follow the **directions below** to **turn in the assignment** to the instructor:
      1. **Link your slides** in the [course tracker](https://make.sc/trackbew1.3).
      1. **Presentations are a significant factor** when calculating **your midterm grade**!
      1. If the **tracker does not include a link to your slide deck by the due date**, **you risk receiving a _NOT PASSING_ midterm grade**!
