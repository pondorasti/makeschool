## Normal Distribution, CLT and Z-Scores [(Slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ja5ehlVgWolbZGhQQr8hKzoIQgvMwfydS3f6vDCS2Wc/edit?usp=sharing)

### Topics
- Advanced Descriptive Statistics
  - The Standard Normal Distribution
  - Applications of the Central Limit Theorem
  - Intro to Z-Scores
  - Converting Z-Scores to Probabilities (and Vice Versa)
- Introduction to Net Promoter Scores (NPS)

### Resources
- Go through [this article on the normal (Gaussian) distribution](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-normal-distribution.html) by Math Is Fun
- Read this [article on Z-scores and distributions](http://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/z-score/)
- Watch WSU math professor Dr. Poyser's [fascinating video on normal distributions and z-scores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZWd56VlN7w)

### Challenges
- Create sampling distribution of means from column in US income dataset (Use previously-built custom functions)
- Answer 3-5 descriptive stats questions using stats module's `.zscore()`, `.norm.cdf()`, and `.norm.sf()`
- Complete [this notebook on CLT and distributions](../Notebooks/NormalDistribution.ipynb)

### Stretch Challenges
- Write a custom function to calculate the Z-Score of one or many data points in a distribution
- Write a custom `.describe()` function returning important descriptive stats in a tabular manner from a non-DataFrame dataset (NP array, Python list)
