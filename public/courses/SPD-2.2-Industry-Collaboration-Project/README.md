## Assignments

### **1. Analytics and Growth Assignment**
Successful engineers and product developers know the performance of their products. How? Through on-site metrics. Metrics inform feature prioritization, design success, user validation, business objectives and are used by marketing, finance, QA, founders, and almost every division of the business. You’ll be a wicked wise engineer if know how to implement and analyze the metrics on your products. This is an assignment you will do solo on your own (without working with your team) and submit individually. This term, you’ll PICK ONE of three options to demonstrate your mastery of these concepts:

**CHOOSE ONE OPTION BELOW:**

**Option 1: Analytics and Growth Experiments in your own project ([Assignment HERE](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/201198/assignments/767092/))** <br>
*Good for people interested in startups, entrepreneurship*
- Install analytics on one of your personal projects or a new landing page
- Do two growth experiments
- Write a short blog post about it

**Option 2: Metrics and Engineering challenges ([ASSIGNMENT HERE](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/201198/assignments/767093/))** <br>
*Good for folks of more engineering-focused students*
- Answer questions on growth case studies
- Complete challenges related to conceptual knowledge
- Advise teammates on data driven decisions

**Option 3: Make School’s web analytics ([ASSIGNMENT HERE](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/201198/assignments/794179/))** <br>

### **2. Peer Evaluations** 
Get an average score above a 3 on your Peer Evaluation. Students who perform below a 3 on the first evaluation can still pass if their second evaluation is above a 3. Peer evaluation form will be given out in class and on Gradescope. The peer evaluation involves peers ranking their teammates on a 1-5 scale across 7 dimensions of collaboration - these dimensions are weighted equally to come up with a composite score that must be above a 3 to pass.
 - **Conducted Nov 5th & Dec 1st**

### **3. Product V2** 
Ship team-decided version 2 of your product. This product was started in SPD 2.1 and is a continuation of the industry collaboration project. Students are building their product in partnership with an actual organization in industry which will help them develop cross-department collaboration skills. Student teams determine goals for their V2 along with the instructor and industry partner.
