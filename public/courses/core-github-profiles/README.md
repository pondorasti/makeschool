# Core Github Profiles 

Your GitHub profile is important it's likely the first place a recruiter will look to 
learn more about you. 

It needs to express your ability clearly and honestly.

Your profile not only shows the code you have created it shows how you create code and 
how you work. 

Making a good profile that impresses people will take time and effort. 

Your GitHub profile will get you hired. It's the most important evidence of your 
ability.

## What does an Amazing GitHub profile look like? 

With a partner examine some profiles here:

Examine these GitHub profiles closely. 

- Look at the profile page. 
  - Repositories, stars, Followers
  - organizations, profile image, location
  - Popular repos
    - Read the description
  - Contributions
- Examine a repos
  - Look at commits and branches
  - Look at the README, read it. 
  - What kind of project are they working on?
  - How many releases?
  
## What can you do to improve your GitHub profile

- Add your location information. Recruiters use search tools and filter out profiles based on 
location. Having this information on your profile makes it easy for them to find you.
- Commit often. It’s nice to have those little green squares show up on your profile. 
 - Don't manipulate to get them your commit history. It’s easy to figure out and if 
 someone sees it, you will be rejected.
- Make clean commit messages. It’s easy to have commit messages like “pleaseeee work”, “@#$%”, 
etc. Don’t do that. Show your profesionalism in your Github profile.
- Have awesome (formatted) documentation for _all_ your projects. 
  - Include plenty of usage examples. 
  - Include installation instructions (a demo/screenshot is a huge bonus). When recruiters are going 
through your profile, they will not have time to figure out how to run your. 
- If you want others to contribute to your project, have clear contributing guidelines. 
  - Include a License. 
  - If you are welcoming contributions, a blog post explaining the design decisions or a simple 
  overview is very helpful!
- Add description and tags for your projects.
- use Github Pages to create a site for your project, or create links to your GitHub and the project 
on your portfolio site. 
  - Add GitHub links to your Make School Portfolio. 
- There are many Github integrations available (like Travis CI, etc).
- Don’t fork repositories if you are not going to work on them. Cluttered profiles don’t make 
anyone happy. If you like a project, please star it, not fork.
- Contribute to open source projects. This shows that you can work well with 
a community, you know how to dive into large codebases and can adapt to different coding 
standards. Having pull requests/issues/reviews visible on your profile makes it a bit attractive.
- Write clean code. Have a good project structure.
  - Write tests.

After reading the list above look at your GitHub profile and find three things you
