Report on your challenge progress so far.

### Activity II

**Discussion**

- Identify and discuss in more depth the differences between each solution in [FizzBuzz in Too Much Detail](https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-design/fizzbuzz-in-too-much-detail/).
- Review the interviewing best practices from [How to: Work at Google — Example Coding/Engineering Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw).
- Have students share any acronyms they came up with.

## Work Out (45 min)

### Activity III

**Assumptions Worksheet**

[Worksheet (p 2-4)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fp_aW0JRA_l7RdYXfcEBKQ0xfg9lTtx_EVsEF0NCpDo/edit?usp=sharing)

- As a class, work through the first three questions of the example prompt
- Individuals write their first three answers to the next prompt on paper or a whiteboard.
- Pair and share answers with classmates and all agree which assumptions to use for that prompt.
- Individuals write out their solutions to the prompt given the selected assumptions on paper or a whiteboard.
- Pair and share solutions with classmates.
- Complete all prompts if time allows.

## Wrap Up (5 min)

- Share/pair feedback on recent activity
- Highlight key takeaways
- Begin challenges

## Make Up (if absent or overly tardy)

### Research and Report

1. Speak to two peers who were in class about the activities that they did and how useful they found them to be.
