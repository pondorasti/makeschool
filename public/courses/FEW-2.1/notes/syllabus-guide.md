# Product College Course Template 

This guide applies to courses taught at the PC/Make School. Tutorials or other resources 
should either be created as tutorials (see below) or added to Product College labs. 

Courses are hosted at: [Product College Courses](https://github.com/Product-College-Courses)

The course hosted on GitHub should be the source of information used by students
during any term. Students can always refer to a course repo for the latest up to 
date information, links to resources, and other relevant information.

The GitHub Repo will contain the syllabus and all of the course session outlines. It will 
also contain vocabulary, best practice, resources, and other information.

Starter code, and resources that contain directories and files should be hosted at 
[Product College Labs](https://github.com/Product-College-Labs). 

## Create a new Course

Create a new course on [Product College Courses](https://github.com/Product-College-Courses/).

### Naming the course

Courses should be named with catalog abbreviation and number followed by the description 
followed by the course name. For example, the course: 

> FEW 1.1 Advanced HTML CSS JavaScript

would become: 

> FEW-1.1-Advanced-HTML-CSS-JavaScript

### Intialize the Course with a README

Intialize the course with a README.md. This will contain the course syllabus. 

### Initial the course with a License

Choose the MIT license. 

## Use the Course Template

Use the course [course-template](./course-template.md) as a starting point for your 
putting your course on the Product College Github. 

You can paste the contents of this template into your course README. What's important 
is the headings and outline. It's good for students if all courses follow the same 
structure. 

**Please follow this template! This is important for BPPE compliance.**

Everything *not* marked *optional* should be included in the top level README in the 
Github repo. 

- [course-template](./course-template.md)

### Use Markdown

Write your class using Markdown. Follow the structure of the course template. Make
sensible use of Headings, Lists, and other mark up. 

#### Tips

Use Headings in order! Only one H1 heading per page. For example the page might start 
with an H1, the next heading will be an H2, if another sub topic appears that needs a 
heading use an H3. When the next new topic appears it is an H2. 

## Post to Product College Github

Write your courses and post them to the product college Github.
Courses should be posted to 'Product College Classes'.

### Organizing Examples and Resources

If your class needs to link to large and complex sample/starter projects post these 
to 'Product College Labs'. Small sample files can be included in the main class 
repository.
