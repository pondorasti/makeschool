# FEW 2.2 - Apply SASS to a past project

## Description 

This assignment is made up of three short assignments. The goal of these is to learn and apply the SASS language to your style sheets. 

The three parts are: 

1. Solve the challenges in the sample code: https://github.com/Make-School-Labs/few-2-2-lesson-04
1. Apply SASS to your CSS animation created in the previous assignment. 
1. Apply SASS to one of your previous web projects. This can be a class homework assignment, an intensive project, or a personal project.

## Slides 

This slide show has a quick intro to SASS.

### Why this assignment?

SASS is a common industry-standard tool, expect to see it in use at any place you may work. You should know what it is and how it works. By implementing SASS in your work you will get a close-up view of what it does and how to work with it.

## Project requirements

You'll turn in each of the three parts to this assignment to Gradescope.

### Part 1 - Challenges 

Install the SASS CLI and solve the challenges here: https://github.com/Make-School-Labs/few-2-2-lesson-04

Submit your work to GradeScope.

### Part 2 - Apply SASS to your CSS Animation

Apply SASS to your CSS animation (this is the assignment from the previous week.) You can start by changing the file extension of your style sheet to `.scss`.

You should make use of the following elements in your code: 

- variables
- math operators
- for loops
- nested rules

Stretch goals: 

SASS has a few more features that you can make use of. Applying these your code: 

- @import
- @mixin
- SASS Modules https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules

### Part 3 - Apply SASS to a past project 

Choose a past project that has a style sheet. Rewrite that style sheet in SASS. 

The project you choose can be any web project a past assignment, a past intensive project, or a personal project. 

Choose a project that has a reasonable scope. A large group project might not be a good choice here. You need to be able to finish it this week. 

### Deliverable

Each of the three parts of this assignment will be submitted via GradScope. 

### Due date

Class 4

## Assessing the assignment

| Expectations | Does not meet | Meets | Exceeds |
|:-------------|:---------------------------|:----------------------|:---------------------------------|
| Completion | You have minimally applied SASS or not at all | You have looked every line of CSS and applied SASS at each applicable point | You can found new and interesting ways to apply SASS, you've probably used mixins, functions, and loops |
| Quality | The code is poorly written, only you would understand it | Your code is well written. Names are well-chosen and descriptive. | Even you are impressed with your code. The comments rival what you see on very popular repos. |
| Comprehension| Can't explain concepts covered | Can explain the concepts covered | Could apply these concepts to new and future projects with ease |
| Work ethic | few massive commits | Commits outline progress | Clearly show the progression of the work, with descriptive commit messages |
