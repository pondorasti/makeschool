## [**20m**] ☀️Warmup

If you get stuck, you can use online resources in the last 8 minutes of the warmup.

The data type should be `float64`.

- Write an `interface` for geometric shapes that defines `area` and `perimeter` functions.
- Write a `struct` that represents a `circle` and a `rectangle`.
- Implement the `interface` for both the `circle` and `rectangle` `struct`s.
- Create a function, named `measure`, that can print the `area` and `perimeter` of any geometric shape.
- In the `main` function, create an instance of each `struct`.
- Call the `measure` function on each instance.
- When the timer goes off, save it as `interfaces.go` on gists.github.com, then DM me the link on Slack.

## [**10m**] ☑️ Review Solution

## [**30m**] 📖 Overview

Today, we'll be going over the [golang-starter-pack](https://github.com/make-school-labs/golang-starter-pack) that we can use as the starting point for today's challenges, as well as the MakeUtility project due at the end of the term.

## [**10m**] 🌴 BREAK

## [**40m**] 💻 Activity

Using the list below as inspiration, replace the Users and Articles entities throughout the example with a has-many relationship of your own choice.

- Trainer has many Pokemon
- Album has many Songs
- Bracelet has many Beads
- Club has many Events

## 🌃 After Class

Complete this mini project by Wednesday at midnight.

You will receive a code review from your instructor as part of your midterm status update.

## 📚 Resources & Credits

- Starter kit based on [`xesina/golang-echo-realworld-example-app`](https://github.com/xesina/golang-echo-realworld-example-app) on GitHub.
