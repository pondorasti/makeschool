## What to display? 

Anything you want as long as it uses data from the provided dataset. 

## Goals 

Your goal is to make something interesting to look at. For this project it's more important to make things on the screen than it is to have people understand what they are seeing. 

While the end goal of data visualization is to showing meaningful trends and patterns, to do that you need to mnaster the skill of putting things on the screen first.
