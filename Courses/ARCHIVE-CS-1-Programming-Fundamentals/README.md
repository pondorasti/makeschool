# ARCHIVE - CS1--Programming Fundamentals

## NOTE: This repo is no longer maintained

## Prerequisites

This course is designed to help equip students with the technical skills and foundational knowledge necessary
to succeed at Make School.  As such, there are no prerequisites for this course.  

## Course Overview

This course is designed to help students with beginner-level coding experience master
the fundamentals of coding and Computer Science, so that they will be well-equipped to
get the most out of all the other courses they'll take at Make School. This course will cover
the foundations of Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming, functions and recursion, debugging,
best practices for solving problems, and how to write clean, structured code.  

### Who should enroll (optional)

Students in the Product College come with varying levels of experience in coding and Computer Science.  
Some students may have already gained the knowledge and skills found in this course in their studies
prior to enrollment.  As a result, we have created a diagnostic exam to help students determine if this
course is right for them.  

## Learning Objectives

This course will be taught in Python, and will cover the following concepts:

* Variables, assigment, operators, compound assignment operators, precedence
* Data Types (Integers, Floating Point Numbers, Strings, Objects)
* Collections (lists/arrays, tuples, dictionaries)
* String Manipulation (splitting, concatenation, interpolation, special characters)
* Boolean values, operators, expressions, short-circuit evaluation
* Control flow structures and loops (if/elif/else, for, while, break, continue)
* Functions (returning values, parameters, arguments, default values, scoping)
* Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, `self`, inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding)
* Importing libraries/modules/packages
* Running python scripts
* Command-Line arguments
* User input, printing, string formatting
* File I/O (reading from/writing to files)

This course will also cover the following general programming concepts, which can be
applied to any language:

* Semantic variable naming, code formatting, and Conventions
* Breaking down large problems into incremental steps
* Stubbing out functions and methods
* Debugging, printouts, problem isolation
* Purpose of abstractions such as functions, classes, modules
* Thread blocking (function calls, user input, web requests)
* Recursion, infinite loops, progress towards goal (base case)
* Assert statements, basic unit testing
* Error Handling, exceptions (try, catch/except, throw/raise)
* Making HTTP requests to web APIs
* Parsing JSON documents

Finally, this course will also cover the following high-level computer science concepts:

* Pseudocode as an abstraction
* Advantages/disadvantages of interpreted vs. compiled languages
* Language abstraction (High-level vs. low-level vs. assembly vs. machine code)
* Binary number representations
* Persistence of memory (RAM vs. disk)

## Learning Outcomes

Students that complete this course will be able to exhibit the following competencies
in each area:


### General Computer Science Knowledge

**Student(s) will be able to:**

* Select appropriate data types to create, manipulate, and store data.
* Explain the trade-offs between interpreted and compiled languages, and use this knowledge to select appropriate languages for the task at hand.  
* Convert numbers from Decimal to Binary, and from Binary to Decimal.  
* Explain the importance of binary numbers in modern computing, and connect this to
higher-level concepts used in their code such as boolean logic and conditional statements.  

### Programming concepts

**Student(s) will be able to:**

* Write clean, well-structured code with semantic naming conventions for variables,
functions, and objects.  
* Identify patterns that can cause infinite loops, and avoid them as needed.  
* Demonstrate appropriate use of abstraction by refactoring code into modular functions,
classes, and modules as necessary.
* Revise and refactor monolithic code blocks using OOP concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism to make code more readable and reusable.  
*  Investigate problems and debug code, including code that they didn't write.
* Compare and contrast iterative and recursive solutions for coding problems, and explain
the benefits and drawbacks of each.  
* Create basic unit tests and follow the "red-green-refactor" method for writing and improving code.
* Write scripts that make use of 3rd party libraries, modules, frameworks, and/or APIs.
* Assess the potential problems that can arise when making HTTP requests, and effectively
deal with these problems using exceptions.

### Programming in Python

**Student(s) will be able to:**

* Write "clean, Pythonic" code that follows PEP8 conventions.
* Apply their knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming to use inheritance to write "D.R.Y.", reusable code, including abstract superclasses.
* Create, manipulate, and iterate on various collections, including lists, arrays, and tuples.
* Use list comprehensions to programmatically create lists in Python.  
* Create python scripts that can accept arguments at the Command Line when the script is called.  
* Read, modify, and write to files (new or existing) using best practices in Python.
* Explain what the `self` keyword means and how it is used in Python.
* Compare and contrast procedural, Object-Oriented, and functional approaches to solving problems, and select the best approach for the problem at hand.  
* Create basic unit tests in python using the `unittest` module, `Pytest`, or other equivalent libraries.
* Write conditional statements that use short-circuiting to improve runtime.  
* Demonstrate mastery over string concatenation and interpolation in Python.
* Identify the recursive step and base case when shown recursive functions.
* Refactor iterative approaches into recursive functions, and apply their knowledge of each approach to determine which approach has the best time and space complexity.  
* Call a web API and parse the JSON response.

### Projects

1. **Hangman**
  --Students will gain experience with abstraction, helper functions, data types,
  string manipulation, collections, and other foundational concepts by coding up
  a version of the classic "Hangman" game that can be played in the terminal.  

2. **Object-Oriented Programming Gradebook**
  -- In this project, students will take advantage of Object-Oriented Programming to
  build a gradebook system to help a teacher keep track of their students. More details coming soon!

3. **Simulating Herd Immunity**  
  -- For their final project, students will design and build a simulation that models a the spread
  of a virus over a population to demonstrate the epidemiology concept of herd immunity.  This project will require students to
  demonstrate mastery of all concepts covered in this course, and will stretch their programming skills
  with optional components including web servers and basic data visualization.  

### Vocabulary & Conventions
Throughout the course, we will learn and make use of technical vocabulary.  Any technical words/topics/phrases
worth remembering should be listed here.  Here's the catch:  they have to be added by you, the students.  I
*strongly encourage* you to make pull requests to this document and add new definitions of vocabulary, examples of
coding conventions, and anything you find useful.  This will give you a great cheat sheet to look back on as needed,
while also strengthening your git skills!  



### Best Practices

Success in this course (and at Make School!) happens because of growth through **_deliberate practice._**
Coding is a muscle, and muscles only grow if you use them! Students in this course should find time to code
_every day_.  This does not necessarily have to be on a project, or even on work for this course! Some of your
most productive days will be days where you don't have any work assigned, and some of your biggest breakthroughs
will come while coding for fun!

For students seeking extra practice, I have included a list of my favorites in the _Resources_ section.

### Resources

Python 3 Documentation: For when you know what you want to say, but aren't sure of the correct syntax.

Project Euler: A website of math-flavored programming challenges, where solutions for a problem will often act as
helper functions for subsequent problems.  These are great for strengthening your problem solving and algorithmic skills--they're also very addicting!

Coding Bat: A great place to practice programming by completing challenges in python.  

Think Like a Computer Scientist:  A free, online text book in python that takes students from "Hello World" all the way to data structures and algorithms.  Students may occasionally be assigned readings from this textbook
before class.  

Atom: A free, open-source text editor from Github.  Although this is the recommended text editor for the course, students are free to use any text editor they feel comfortable with.  

NOTE:  This is a living document, so resources may be added to this list throughout the year.  

### Evaluation    
<!-- TODO:  Add links to project rubrics -->

In order to pass this course, students must successfully complete all three projects.  
Each project will be evaluated according to a project-specific rubric, which can be found
at the end of each project description.
