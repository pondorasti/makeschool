 # Very Able
 ## An Introduction to Variables

 In this project we will "beat" some microgames by writing code! Never coded before or even seen code? Perfect :) We’ll show you what to do and explain it along the way.

 ## Swift Playgrounds

 We will be using _Swift Playgrounds_ to teach you how to code. _Playgrounds_ are interactive coding environments that can contain instructions. The code you write gets run every time you make a change and visual output is displayed on the right. This makes it a great way to learn how to code!

 ## What you'll learn

 In these _Playgrounds_, you will learn how to use _variables_. _Variables_ are a way to store and refer to values by a readable name. _Variables_ can hold all sorts of values: a number, a word, or even complex collections of other variables!
