## Course Overview

Welcome to iOS1! This class introduces you the basics of iOS development. We will learn some basic to intermediate topics about Swift, Xcode and iOS.

## Objectives

- Learn basic and intermediate Swift.
- Leverage Xcode to manage and debug projects.
- Get familiar with common iOS communication patterns.

## Competencies

At the end of the course students should be able to:

- Write working Swift code
- Make use of the delegate design pattern, including creating their own delegates
- Explain callbacks, and provide an example of what they are used for in iOS Development.  
- Identify opportunities for creating their own delegates, and make use of the Delegation pattern to solve problems in their app. 
- Use Xcode’s debugging tools to identify and solve problems in their app. 
- Design and create basic constraints with Interface Builder. 
- Explain the Model-View-Controller design pattern, and make use of it in their app.  
- Write code with Object Oriented Programming in Swift.
- Explain memory management in Swift and identify and break retain cycles.
