## Course Description

This course covers the process and tools used to build single page applications (SPA) using the most up-to-date tools and techniques. Students will learn to manage state and render on state changes using reactive programming techniques. Modern JavaScript libraries including React will be used.

### Why you should know this

Single pages Applications are the norm for web applications today. They provide a higher level of functionality not available to simple web pages.

Single page applications are the basis for most of your favorite web destinations and the future of mobile computing!

If you want to build next-generation mobile experiences that reach the widest possible audience with greatest functionality single page applications are a good bet.

## Homework

During the course of the class you will build the following projects: 

1. [Assignment 1 - React Product List](Assignments/Assignment-01.md)
2. [Assignment 2 - Weather API](Assignments/Assignment-02.md)
3. [Assignment 3 - React + Redux Tutorial](Assignments/Assignment-03.md)
4. [Assignment 4 - Custom Project](Assignments/Assignment-04.md)

You should submit each of these assignments to GradeScope. 

Besides the projects above, you are also responsible for completing the self assessment questions on GradeScope. There is one following each lessons. Use thes to measure how much of the course material you have absorbed. 

You will follow all of the lessons in the videos playlist below. 

- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoN_ejT35AEhmWcDTI6M--ha_E4lTyAtx

The videos are labeled "lesson XX Y" where XX is the lesson number 01, 02, 03 etc. and Y is video number. You should watch all of the videos for each lesson matching the lessons in the schedule above.
