# Jigsaw - making a request 🧩

- Class will be divided into groups.
- Depending on how many members, choose one or two of the following links, making sure all the links are taken.

- [Link 1](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-1.3-Dynamic-iOS-Apps/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson7/assignments/request/handle.md)
- [Link 2](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-1.3-Dynamic-iOS-Apps/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson7/assignments/request/make.md)
- [Link 3](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-1.3-Dynamic-iOS-Apps/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson7/assignments/request/present.md)
- [Link 4](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-1.3-Dynamic-iOS-Apps/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson7/assignments/request/setup.md)
- [Link 5](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-1.3-Dynamic-iOS-Apps/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson7/assignments/request/configure.md)


- As a group collaboratively write the code to perform a network request using
[codeshare](https://codeshare.io).

- Each member will write their step as they explain the importance of it and what it is doing.

- You will make a network call to fetch the information for the Pokemon of your choice, using the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co)

- When you are done, someone try the code in a playground to see if it works.

- Use Decodable to parse the data into a struct to print out just the name and id of the Pokemon.

- Share the codeshare link with the instructor (send it over slack).
