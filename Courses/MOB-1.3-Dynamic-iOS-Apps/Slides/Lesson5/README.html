# Memory Management

## [Slides](https://make-school-courses.github.io/MOB-1.3-Dynamic-iOS-Apps/Slides/Lesson5/README.html ':ignore')

## Why you should know this

The key to developing **high-performance** iOS apps is to know how your components consume memory and how to optimize memory use.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Poor optimization can result in code issues, including **memory leaks** and potentially **fatal errors**.

***Important:*** *iOS keeps track of how much memory each app uses on a given device, and it is set up to kill apps that consume too much.*
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Learning objectives

At the end of this class, you should be able to...

1. Explain how memory management works in Swift, including when and why to use **strong**, **weak**, or **unowned**
2. Identify and resolve **strong reference** cycles (aka, retain cycles)
3. Demonstrate proficiency in using **built-in tools** and techniques to find memory leaks caused by retain cycles
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Memory Leaks

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l3q2MDnkLri1t7i5a" width="480" height="360" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>

When an instance of a **reference type** remains in memory even after its lifecycle has ended. Leaked memory still counts as a portion of an app’s total memory, even though the objects causing the leaks are no longer needed or useful.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Value Types

When you create a new instance of a **value type**, the right amount of memory is set aside for it. Whenever you do anything with it, Swift creates a **copy** of it.

When that instance no longer exists, Swift automatically reclaims its allocated memory. ♻️

In Swift, you do not need to do anything to manage memory used by value types. 🙌🏼

<aside class ="notes">
Examples of value types: Primitive types, tuples, enums, structs (including String, Array, Dictionary, Set)
</aside>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Reference Types & ARC

With **reference types** its a different story. 😰

Passing around an instance of a **reference type** (class, closure) or storing it as a property does not copy it — it creates an additional reference to the same instance.

In other words, you are creating an additional reference to the same memory location on the heap.

## Reference Counting 🔢

The action to store a **reference count** of every initialized objects (classes, pointers, blocks).

Reference count = The number of references to the actual memory allocated for that instance.

**As long as an instance’s reference count is greater than 0, the instance remains alive, and its memory will not be reclaimed.**
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Using the deinit() function

A `deinit()` function is called immediately before a class instance is deallocated.

You can use this function to perform **clean up** or other actions just before the instance is deallocated.

As soon as the instance's reference count becomes 0, its `deinit()` function will run, and its memory will be deallocated.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Deinit example

</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Activity: Leaky Starship

1. Download the starter app: [LeakyStarship](https://github.com/VanderDev1/LeakyStarship)
2. Find one of the three `deinit()` functions in the app.
3. Set a breakpoint that will stop at one of the `deinit()` functions
3. Run the app, click the button on main scene, and examine what happens at each breakpoint (When done, disable all breakpoints)

What happened at each `deinit()`? 🤨
<!--
Part 2 - In Pairs
1. Discuss with your partner what occurred at each `deinit()` breakpoint and why?

## Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)

In 2011, Apple introduced Automated Reference Counting (ARC).

<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/D2FWPh0IbFA" data-autoplay  width="700" height="500"></iframe>

<aside class="notes">
With ARC, the compiler is now responsible for analyzing your code and for managing reference counts of class instances — so you do not have to.

However, because Swift handles memory automatically, it is still critical to understand how iOS manages memory, as there are some common mistakes that can cause memory issues…
</aside>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Strong References & Ownership

<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/usvj1E8mGyI" data-autoplay  width="700" height="500"></iframe>

<aside class="notes">
A strong reference increments the reference count of the instance to which it points. When one instance of a reference type (A) has a reference to another (B), we say that A is an owner of B.

By retaining a reference to B, A protects B from being deallocated by ARC.

By default, all references you create are strong references.
</aside>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Strong Reference Cycles

<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/9g23hKXZWEg" data-autoplay  width="700" height="500"></iframe>

<aside class="notes">
If two reference types each hold strong references to each other — if A retains a reference count for B, and B also retains A — they have a strong reference cycle (aka, a retain cycle).

Strong reference cycles are one type of memory leak.

</aside>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How to Break Strong Reference Cycles

<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/3uS6IbDHeTA" data-autoplay  width="700" height="500"></iframe>


<aside class="notes">
A variable marked with the *weak* keyword does not take ownership of the object it refers to — it does not increment the reference count of its referenced object.

In the example above, if we add the *weak* attribute to the tenant variable in the Apartment class, and the Person instance is successfully deallocated, the Apartment class's reference to it will now be `nil`.

When you access a weak reference, it will either be a valid object, or `nil`.
</aside>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Because weak references can be changed to `nil` if the instance they point to is deallocated, they come with two inherent requirements:

- **Weak references must always be declared as Optional**, since Optionals are the only types that can become `nil`.

- **Weak references can never be declared as `let`**. Instances declared as `let` cannot change, thus weak references must always be declared as var.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Fixing a retain cycle

[Strong Reference Cycle - repl.it](https://replit.com/team/MOB13/StrongReferenceCycle)

<!--
```Swift
class Person {
     var apartment: Apartment?
}

class Apartment {
    weak var tenant: Person?
}
```
-->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Unowned References

Like a weak reference, an unowned references **does not increase the retain count** of the object it references.

Unlike a weak reference, however, an unowned reference **is assumed to always have a value** — it behaves somewhat like an implicitly unwrapped optional.

Because of this, an unowned reference is always defined as a non-Optional type. An unowned reference **cannot** be `nil`.

## Outro Exercise

1. **Role Play Exercise** - A Mini Practice Interview

- Pair up. For 3 to 5 minutes in each role, take turns playing a Hiring Manager, then a Candidate for an iOS developer position. As the Hiring Manager, ask your Candidate to answer the following questions:

1. When and why would you use the keyword *weak*?
2. What is a *retain cycle*? Can you give examples of when a retain cycle might occur?
3. In Swift, is memory management for *value types* the same as memory management for *reference types*?
-->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Study Challenges

1. Look up *weak* and *unowned*:
- How are they similar? How do they differ?
- When would you use one over the other?
2. Use the **Instruments -> Leaks** tool to identify memory leaks:
- Execute this [Instruments tutorial by Ray Wenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/397-instruments-tutorial-with-swift-getting-started)
- Apply what you have learned in the above tutorial to the original (leaky) version of LeakyStarship to find and fix its leaky CrewMember objects
3. What are the defaults (*weak*, *strong*, *unowned*) for the following constructs? What is your guess as to why Apple chose those defaults for each construct?
- Arrays?
- @IBOutlets?
- Closures?
