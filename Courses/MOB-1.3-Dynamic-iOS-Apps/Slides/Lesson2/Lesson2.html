- Escaping and Non escaping
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why you should know this

Some uses cases of closures:
- Animations
- Fetching data from external APIs
- Completion handlers
- Creating views
- Higher order Functions
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Learning objectives

1. Identify use cases of closures
1. Understand what capturing values mean
1. Know the difference between escaping and non escaping closures
1. Implement closures as completion handlers
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Initial Exercise

1. Breakout session in pairs to brainstorm everything you know about closures.
2. Then write an example.
3. Post it in the slack channel.
4. React to other's example with ✔️ if you understand it and ❓if you are unsure of why it works.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What is a closure?

Self contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code.

<aside class ="notes">
Basically blocks of code that we can assign to a variable, pass around in our code, then called so they can execute their code.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
```swift
let greeting = {
    print("Welcome back!")
}

greeting()
```

<aside class ="notes">
We define a closure and assign it to a constant. The body of the closure is between curly brackets.

Then it gets called by calling the name of the constant with ().
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
```swift
let greeting:(String) -> () = { name in
    print("Welcome back, \(name)!")
}

greeting("Tahoe 🐶")
```
<aside class ="notes">
Same as previous example. The difference is that now we have one parameter of type String. We can use the parameter inside the closure by assigning a local variable "name" to the first parameter of the closure.

The keyword "in" separated the closure parameters and the body.

We can give parameters any name we want to use or leave them blank to use shorthand values.

When we call the closure, it will need a value for such parameter.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
```swift
let greeting:(String) -> () = {
    print("Welcome back, \($0)!")
}

greeting("Tahoe 🐶")
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Trailing closures  

We can send closures as parameters to functions. If the closure happens to be the last parameter sent, we can use **trailing closure syntax**


```Swift
func washHands(action:()->()) {
    print("Get some soap 🧼")
    action()
    print("Hands are clean. 🙌🏼")
}
```

Can be called:

```swift
washHands() {
    print("Singing for 20 seconds 🎤")
}
```

<aside class = "notes">
The closure is written outside of the function call parentheses, this is known as trailing closure. Its purpose is readability (specially for long closures), so it is recommended to use when a function accepts a closure as a final argument.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Pair Activity

<aside class = "notes">
1. Try in a piece of paper first.
3. Now write it in a playground. Do not use auto correct.
4. Explain your code to a partner, why it worked and if it didn't, discuss what it needs to be fixed.

</aside>

Complete the code.

```swift
func giveAdvice(action:(String, String) -> String) {
  //missing code
}

//missing function call
```

So that it prints:

```
When working from home...
X's advice is to X.
```

<!---
func giveAdvice(action:(String, String) -> String) {
    print("When working from home...")
    print(action("Adriana", "follow a daily schedule."))
}

giveAdvice{(passenger:String, destination:String) -> String in
    return "\(passenger)'s advice is to \(destination)"
}
--->
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Capturing values

Closures have a distinct feature that makes them stand out: they can capture values from their surrounding context.

From Apple's documentation:

*A closure can capture constants and variables from the surrounding context in which it is defined. The closure can then refer to and modify the values of those constants and variables from within its body, even if the original scope that defined the constants and variables no longer exists.*

<aside class ="notes">
Variables, functions and closures have a scope. This scope determines if we can access any of them. Simply if a variable, function or closure isn't in a scope, we can access it.
</aside>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
```Swift
let location = "San Francisco"
let explore = {
    print("Exploring \(location)")
}

explore()
```

<aside class = "notes">
The closure assigned to "explore" closes over the local variable "location" since it is available in the scope that the closure is defined in. We can access the constant without declaring it locally inside the closure.
</aside>
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## In Class Activity

Here's another example of closures closing over variables.

```Swift
func addScore(_ points: Int) -> Int
{
    let score = 42

    let calculate = {
        return score + points
    }

    return calculate()
}

let value = addScore(11)
print(value)
```

Take a screenshot of the code and using different colors or any other way to mark a difference, show where the **global** scope, **local** scope and **closure** scope are.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Once everyone is done, discuss the solution.

- Closures only capture elements that are used in the closure. When a variable isn’t accessed in the closure, it isn’t captured.
- Capturing only works one way. The closure captures the scope it is defined in, but code “outside” a closure doesn’t have access to values “inside” the closure. Like a one way mirror.
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Escaping and non escaping closures

Closures come in two different variants - **escaping** and **non-escaping**.

When a closure is escaping it means that the closure will outlive, or leave the scope that you’ve passed it to.

Non-escaping closures are called within the function it was passed into.

<aside class ="notes">
An example of an escaping closure is a completion handler. It’s executed in the future, after a lengthy task completes, so it outlives the function it was created in.
</aside>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
In an **escaping closure**, the lifecycle looks like this:

1. Passing the closure to a function as argument
1. Function performs a task
1. Return compiler back
1. The closure runs asynchronously

<aside class ="notes">
This means that the closure outlives the function (it is called after the function has returned).

By default, all closures are non escaping. This helps with memory management.
</aside>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
In a **non escaping closure**, the lifecycle looks like this:

1. Passing the closure to a function as argument
1. Function performs a task
1. Running the closure
1. Return compiler back

<aside class ="notes">
A non-escaping closure does not outlive the function from where it was called.
</aside>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Completion handler activity

Closures are used in completion handlers.

Take a look at the code snippet and analyze how closures are being used and the order in which lines get executed.

```Swift
func flyAway(finalStage: String){
    print("\(finalStage) emerged, flying away... ")
}

func metamorphosis(initialStage:String, completion: (String) -> Void){
    print("Caterpillar creates cocoon.")
    // They stay inside for up to 21 days.
    for _ in 1...21 {
        print("\(initialStage) inside cocoon")
    }
    completion("🦋")
}

metamorphosis(initialStage:"🐛", completion: flyAway)

```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Q:** Where is the lengthy task being simulated?<br>
**Q:** Can you make the last call using a trailing closure?<br>

Now implement your own example. Make sure to put in a context, get creative 🌮 👽 💣.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Creating an analogy

In groups of 4

Now that we know more about closures. Create an analogy that will help you remember how they work.

Think about what makes them special.<br>
Maybe differentiate between escaping and non-escaping?<br>
How they work as completion handlers?

Share with the rest of the class via slack.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Lab time

- Playground to review closures

Suggestion<br>
- Read the articles on the additional resources section and write down questions you still have about closures. Send them to the slack channel.
