    // Create a function that takes a name and title and returns an object containing these two properties
    // The object should look something like: {name: "Rudolf", title: "leader of the pack"}
    
    // Define an array (nameTitle) then push 5 name/title objects from your function.
    
    // Write a function that takes a letter (a, b, c, etc) and returns an array containg all of the

    // Write a function takes a title, and returns an array of all objects that have a matching title. 
    // Use filter again. 
    
    // Write a function that returns an array containing strings made from the names and titles. 
    // Each string should look like: "Name Title" or "Diana the duchess of york" or something similar. 
    // Use array.map().
    
    // Create an array of random numbers. Bonus: Use a loop and add 100 random numbers or write a function to return an array of any number of random numbers. 
    
    // Write a function that returns an aray of all numbers 0.5 and above. use filter, map, or reduce.

  // A second set of problems to solve if you finished the first group and needed more to challenge you. 
  
  // Practice your Math
  
  // As an aspiring app developer your goal is to gamify everything in existence. You're not sure
  // how you will do this but, you are sure it will require lots of random numbers!
  
  // Challenge 1
  // Write a method that generates random numbers within a range. Your function should take in two 
  // params: min and max, returning number in the range of min and max inclusive. 
  
  // Challenge 2
  // You need to generate characters for the world favorite RPG game. You need a function that 
  // generates three random numbers between 1 and 6, and returns the total. 
  
  // Challenge 3 
  // Make a new function that generates 4 random numbers between 1 and 6, drops the the lowest 
  // value and returns the sum of the three remaining. 
  
  // Challenge 4
  // You need to generate all sorts of random numbers, simulating rolling dice of any conceivable 
  // number of sides. You've decided to tackle this by writing a one function to rule them all!
  // Your function will take in a string in the form of

  // Where n is the number of dice to roll, d is the letter 'd' and s is the number of sides. For 
  // example 1d6 would be a single die with 6 sides. 3d13 would be 3 dice each with 13 sides. 
  // Your function will return a random number representing the die roll. For example I should 
  // expect 1d6 to return a number between 1 and 6, 2d6 would return a number between 2 and 12.
  // Your function should handle a range of input. 
  
  // 1 d 6, 1 d6, 1d 6, d6, d    6 <-- should work as 1d6
  // 1D20 <-- Should work as 1d20 (note the cap)
  // xd3, 4d#, 2x4 <-- Badly formed values should return undefined
  
  // Test your work and generate die rolls: 
  
  // 1d6, 3d6, 2d4, 20dr

    Problem 
    
    You are making the worlds most amazing app. It gamifies everyday tasks like walking to the store 
    and drinking milk. It also uses a lot of circles for some reason. You need to write a method to 
    convert degrees to radians. 
    
    1 degree = π/180 degrees
    radians = degrees × π / 180°
    
    Write a function that takes in degrees and returns radians. 
    
    You might also need to convert radians to degrees. Write a function for this. Your function should 
    take in degrees and return radians. 
    
  Problem
  
  Use the Haversine formula below to write a function that returns the distance between two points. 
  
  The Haversine Formula

  One of the main challenges to calculating distances - especially large ones - is accounting for the 
  curvature of the Earth. If only the Earth were flat, calculating the distance between two points would be 
  as simple as for that of a straight line! The Haversine formula includes a constant (it's the R variable below) 
  that represents the radius of the Earth. Depending on whether you are measuring in miles or kilometers, it 
  would equal 3956 mi or 6367 km respectively.
  The basic formula is:

  dlon = lon2 - lon1
  dlat = lat2 - lat1
  a = (sin(dlat/2))^2 + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * (sin(dlon/2))^2
  c = 2 * atan2( sqrt(a), sqrt(1-a) )
  distance = R * c (where R is the radius of the Earth)

  R = 6367 km OR 3956 mi

  Keep in mind that the Haversine formula is not 100% accurate because the Earth is not a perfect sphere - 
  it bulges at the equator. Hence, distances near the equator would be underestimated while those near the polar 
  regions would be overestimated. Nonetheless, the Haversine gives a good enough approximation for most 
  applications.
  
  Latitude and Longitude are in units of degrees, while sin(), cos(), and atan() expect radians!
