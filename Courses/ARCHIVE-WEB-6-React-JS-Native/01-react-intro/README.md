# React

## Intro

React is a library made to create User Interfaces in JavaScript Applications. 
In the context of MVC architecture React would represent the V or View layer. 

I think that React represents a new way of thinking and is an alternative to 
traditional MVC architecture.

### Why Learn React? 

React is the future of front end web applications. 
React is an evolution in application design. It's not just for the web 
and the feature of the framework offer new and more reliable ways to 
create your applications. 

React is used by all of the big companies. 

- Airbnb
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Netflix
- NY Times
- Khan Academy
- Codecademy
- WhatsApp
- Vivaldi Browser
- Dropbox
- Yahoo Mail

And many small compaines and startups.

React goes beyond web applications. React Native is framework for 
building truly native apps in React with code written in JavaScript. 

- FaceBook 
- FaceBook Ads
- Sykpe
- Instagram
- Walmart
- Airbnb
- SoundCloud Pulse
- Yeti Smart Home 
- Uber Eats

React has a component based architecure that makes creating 
app easy and flexible. It represents a new way of thinking 
and structuring code for delivering information. 

People are using React for things beyond the web.

- [Sketch App](https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp) - Build Sketch Documents with React

**Why would they do this it's madness?** 

There are a lot of reasons. I think you look at the situation deeply it's all about productivity. 
React has a lot to recommend itself. 

The Principal of Least Power

> Computer Science spent the last forty years making languages which 
> were as powerful as possible. **Nowadays we have to appreciate the 
> reasons for picking not the most powerful solution but the least 
> powerful.** The less powerful the language, the more you can do with 
> the data stored in that language.

Why JavaScript? 

> Atwood's Law: any application that can be written in JavaScript, will

Enough talk let's look at some code!

### Basic Concepts and Vocabulary

React has a few concepts at it's core. 

- Components - The building blocks of React Apps. You need to be able to identify and 
write your own components. 
- Virtual DOM - Used to increase performance. The virtual DOM is a key part of React. 
What it does explains some of React's features. 
- JSX - An Extension of the JS language that enables React's declarative style. 
Writing JSX is an important of writing components. You need to apply the syntax. 

### Overview 

After working on the tutorial form groups and discuss the tutorial and React. 
Each group is tasked to focus on one of the concepts below. After discussion groups 
present to the class.

Break 

After the break students continue working on the challenges.

## Competencies 

- Identify parts of a web page that can be built with components.
- Use Components to make simple web pages.
  - Differentiate between simple stateful components.
  - Construct pages with components.
- Compose pages with components.
- Use JSX to create COM elements in components.

**Discussion**

- Review the starter project. 
- Outline and pseudo code challenges 
  - Add sub title 
  - Use the title component in the list 
  - Add a subtitle to each list item
- Stub method/components/classes for solutions
- Add styles 
  - className

Complete as many of the challenges as you can. Push your work to your fork. 

## Homework 

Facebook has a great tutorial introduction to React. Complete the 
tutorial. Takes notes and bring those notes to class for discussion.
