    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we'll explore add two important techniques to our Data Science toolbox: **_Principal Component Analysis (PCA)_** and **_Clustering_**.  Unlike all the Supervised Learning techniques we've used to far, these two are unique because they are examples of **_Unsupervised Learning_**.  Whereas we require labeled data to double check the accuracy of algorithms like Decision Trees and Naive Bayesian Classifiers, these techniques work on unlabeled data.  While this makes it much easier to apply these techniques to many more kinds of data, it also means that we have no way to measure how well the algorithm is or isn't working.  \n",

    "To help us explore the concept of PCA, we're going to start by applying PCA to the _Iris Dataset_.  We'll then use it to fit a model and classify the flower types as we have done in previous examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Before we begin, watch this primer from StatQuest to understand what PCA, and read this [short (interactive) article](http://setosa.io/ev/principal-component-analysis/) about using PCA on the Iris dataset.  These two examples should help you better understand how PCA works, and more importantly, how it can be useful to you.  "
