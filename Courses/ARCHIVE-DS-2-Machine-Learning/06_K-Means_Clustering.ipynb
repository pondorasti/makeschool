    "In this lesson, we're going to explore another classic Unsupervised Learning technique--**_K-Means Clustering_**.  We'll be working off the same datasets we used in our PCA lesson, and we'll be reusing some of the same code as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><h3>What is Clustering?</h3></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name implies, Clustering refers to a group of unsupervised learning algorithms used for clustering your dataset into a number of subgroups.  In the real world, this is used for things like [customer segmentation](http://searchsalesforce.techtarget.com/definition/customer-segmentation). Clustering is often useful because, as an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, it does not require labeled data in order to work.  The strong majority of data that exists in the world is unlabeled, and obtaining labels is often time-consuming and expensive.  This is both a benefit and a drawback of Unsupervised Learning--the lack of labels means we're able to apply it to much more data, but it also means we have no way of validating the performance of our model as we do in with Supervised Learning algorithms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are [many clustering algorithms](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html), but the one we'll be exploring today is considered one of the classics: K-means Clustering.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**_Challenge:_** Read [this article](https://www.datascience.com/blog/k-means-clustering) on K-means clustering to get a better grasp of how the algorithm works.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><h3>The Datasets</h3></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we'll start by applying the K-means Clustering algorithm to both the `Iris` dataset and the `Wholesale Customers` dataset that we used in the PCA notebook.  For each data set, we'll apply K-means clustering to the raw data, and then to same dataset transformed by PCA to see if there are any noticeable differences.  \n",
    "\n",

    "<center><h3>How to Make it All Work</h3></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity requires us to do a decent bit of data transformation, and to get our hands dirty with Matplotlib.  To make this easier, follown these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Challenge:_** Visualize K-Means Clustering on the Iris Data Set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to accomplish this challenge, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Run all the import statements below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Import the iris dataset using `load_iris()`.  Then, split the data and target into different variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Import a `StandardScaler()` object, and `fit()` the scaler object to the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Use the scaler object to `transform` the data from the iris data set.  Store the scaled data it returns in `scaled_data`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Create a `KMeans()` object.  Make sure you set the `n_clusters` parameter to `3` during this step.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Visualize the results of the K-Means Clustering using a scatterplot object, with the color for each data point denoted by the label it was assigned by the `KMeans()` object during the `fit()` step.  Do this by running the cell below to create a basic visualization.  **Add labels to each axis to make it clear what features we're visualizing.**\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  Extend the code in visualization cell so that it outputs multiple graphs--one for every combination of feature pairs.  (**Hint:** You can script this very easily--consider turning it into a function!)"
