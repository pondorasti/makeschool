    "Its understandable that the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) can seem a bit confusing.  The goal of this notebook is to demystify the CLT by having you write an algorithm that actually uses sampling to approximate a normal distribution from a non-normally distributed data set. \n",

    "In this notebook you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run code to generate a non-normal data set.  \n",
    "1. Create an function to randomly sample subsets of data.\n",
    "1. Create a data set of the means of each sample.\n",
