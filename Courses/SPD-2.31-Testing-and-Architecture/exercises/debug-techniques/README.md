# Debugging Techniques Lab

You've been hired as a software engineer at a new company. Their previous engineer quit unexpectedly, and left some code that... isn't exactly production-ready.

## TODO
For each of the following 3 exercises, your job is to use the techniques covered in class to locate and find the bug(s). 

**As you debug, write down the steps you take in [debug_log.md](debug_log.md).** You'll submit this as your homework assignment.

- [ ] Exercise 1 - Flask Pizza Shop [flask-pizza-shop/](flask-pizza-shop/)
  - **Get the "New Order" page in working order**, so that new pizza orders are displayed correctly on the homepage.
