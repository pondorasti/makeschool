# Pseudocode Lab ([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L1wMNjLkIoL7mXApJZcZJKKYqaOIjOfww5oDyF4yzz0/edit#slide=id.p))

## TT - Why is Pseudocode Important?

- This is a skill you’ll use in interviews for software engineering internships/jobs, even at a senior level
- Great for quickly discussing ideas as a team
- Ease of ideation and iteration
- Provides a way for non-technical stakeholders to understand your work


## In Class Activities

### Examples of Pseudocode

- Start from [this slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L1wMNjLkIoL7mXApJZcZJKKYqaOIjOfww5oDyF4yzz0/edit#slide=id.g50d1ee0923_0_84)
- Going over bad examples of pseudocode, explaining why they're bad, and how they violate problems such as using code syntaxa and being too focused on implementation and not design
- Then we provide an example of how to properly write pseudocode for the given function

### Pseudocode Your Project

- Follow the instructions on [this slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L1wMNjLkIoL7mXApJZcZJKKYqaOIjOfww5oDyF4yzz0/edit#slide=id.g50d1ee0923_0_115) to practice taking an existing function and writing its pseudocode equivalent
- Practice it using the [pseudocode guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b12_AxxP_mNOYlZopvqSDsv5uptiIUDDr459A4Kczfg/edit?ts=5ca51d16#heading=h.qyc1l7b2zpfb)

### Interview Practice Problems

- Follow [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L1wMNjLkIoL7mXApJZcZJKKYqaOIjOfww5oDyF4yzz0/edit#slide=id.g50d1ee0923_0_132) which prompt an interview question, and then you write out the pseudocode solution. Check the answer with a partner and discuss before looking at the solution!
