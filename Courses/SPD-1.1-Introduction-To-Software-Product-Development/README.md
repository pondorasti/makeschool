# SPD 1.1 Introduction to Software Product Development

## Course Description

How can I take my values, ideas, and experiences and make them into great products? Which features should I prioritize? In this beginner project-based course, you’ll learn how to create products that people love. We’ll follow industry best practice of understand user needs (user interviews), build iterative prototypes (wireframes, user journeys, entity relationship diagrams, scoping), and do the work to validate your idea (user testing). This course teaches you how to get the right idea, that you will then ultimately build during the “week long intensive” – our word form of a hackathon – following completion of SPD 1. The lessons learned will apply to your work in other classes, too.

This course also teaches the “success skills” necessary to become a well-rounded product developer, including using professional communication best practices, building healthy habits, and getting feedback from industry contacts and peers.
