# Contributing to Open Source

A learning technique you are familiar with is helping others with bug fixing or adding a new feature in a project. Learning through practice and communicating with others to help them get unblocked is rewarding and helps you level up many skills. Maybe you helped a friend, coworker or someone in your class. This doesn't have to end here, you can help anyone in the world and vice versa thanks to Open Source projects.

### Terminology

Even when each project has their own rules on how to work and contribute, there is terminology that remains the same. Making the first contribution to an open source project can feel intimidating on its own and even more if we are not sure how the mechanics work.

📖 Take some time to read about the [Anatomy of an open source project](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#anatomy-of-an-open-source-project) to become familiar with terms you'll be seeing often.

### Getting started

If this is your first time ever contributing to open source projects or if you want to review the basics, **go through the [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) repository**. It has a step by step guide to make a contribution following the standard *fork → clone → edit → pull request* workflow.

### Choosing a project

Before putting your own projects out to the world, it's a good idea to practice contributing to existing projects. It could be a project that has code you use regularly. If there's something you know needs to be fixed or improved, that could be a good place to start since you are already familiar with the source code.

If you can't think of anything like that, there's many beginner friendly projects to choose from. You can find them in Github with labels such as: `first-timers-only` `good-first-issue` `help wanted` `good-for-beginner` `contribution-starter` `your-first-pr` and similar.

There's also websites to help you find using filters by programming language or tags:

- [Code Triage](https://www.codetriage.com)
- [Awesome for Beginners repo](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners)
- [Good First Issues](https://goodfirstissues.com)

📖 When you find a project, go through [this checklist](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#a-checklist-before-you-contribute) to see if it's a good option before starting.

### Course Credits

Now that you've become familiar with contributing to open source, it's time to put it into practice. Throughout the course you'll have time to make contributions to open source projects.

*What counts as a contribution?*
A well documented and submitted Pull Request.

In the best case scenario these PRs would be accepted into the project, but since it's something we don't have a time frame for and it's not in our control, it won't be required for credit.

📖 Read [these instructions](Assignments/OSProject/Instructions.md) to know about what you'll be doing for this course and how it will be graded.
