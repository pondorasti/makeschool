# FEW 2.5 Visualization 2

The goal of this assignment is to make an interactive visualization. This will be a visualization that has options that change the way it is displayed via user interaction. For example clicking a button to sort on age or fare, or a button to hide and show passengers based on their gender or class. 

## Why know how to do this? 

Interaction is the stock and trade of front end development. You should know how to make user interfaces that display data based on user input. 

## What is this visualization?

This visualization should use the Titanic dataset. You can visualize the data in any way you like. Don't worry about making the data understandable, instead strive to make it interesting to look at and fun to interact with!

Interactions can be anything you like. Think about hiding, showing, sorting, and filtering elements as a good starting place. 

- Buttons show and hide elements
    - By gender
    - Siblings
    - Passenger Class
    - Embarkation
- Buttons sort data 
    - By age
    - Fare
    - Embarkation
    - Passenger Class 
- Hide and show elements
    - Show/Hide passengers by gender
    - Show/Hide passengers by survival
    - Show/Hide passengers by class
    - Show/Hide passengers by embarkation
- Sort passengers 
    - Sort on survival 
    - Sort on gender
    - Sort on fare
    - Sort on age
- Change a property 

You can also think of your own ideas.

Use buttons, toggle buttons, and/or button groups. 

Add some animation by setting the transition property on elements and changing their styles. 

Add your visualization to your Github Pages collection of visualizations.

| Aesthetics    | Uses few styles. Like background color and width or height | Uses a range of colors, adds radius and other styles | Uses a wide range of styles. Uses interesting shapes| 
| Depth        | Displays 2 values from the dataset | Displays 3 or 4 data points | Displays 5 or more data points |
| Code quality | There is code... | Code uses functions and is well organized | Code makes use of functions to minimize redundancy |
| Completion  | Seems incomplete, missing features from the description, is not on GitHub pages | Is on Github pages, has all feature from the homework description | Includes new features and expands on the homework description |
