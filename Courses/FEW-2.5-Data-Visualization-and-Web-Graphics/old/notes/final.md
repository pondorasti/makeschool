# FEW 2.5 Data Visualization Final Assessment

## Use the cereal data to compare cereals. 

Use your graphing skills to compare cereals find the relationship between ingredients and the rating.

Imagein you have been hired by a company that wants to develop a new cereal and they are doing competitive analysis. You are m aking a presentation that will show what is available today and make inferences as to why some products are more popular than others.  

The dataset contains 80 cereals. Each cereal has a **rating** and a list of **ingredients**. Your goal is to graph the data in three graphs and try to show what ingredients make a cereal popular. 

## Cereal Data 

Use the cereal.json data. This data set has the following information for 80 breakfast cereals. 

```JSON
[
  {
    "name": "100% Bran",
    "mfr": "N",
    "type": "C",
    "calories": 70,
    "protein": 4,
    "fat": 1,
    "sodium": 130,
    "fiber": 10,
    "carbo": 5,

## Make Three visualizations 

Make three graphs each a different type. For example: 

- Bar graph
- Pie Chart
- Scatter Plot
- Area
- Radar
- Custom graph/Chart *
	* You can make a custom graph that isn't one of these types but something of your own invention if you like. It should show something meaningful related to the data. 

You can use Chart JS, D3, or your system to show data. 

## Extra credit: Interactive 

Your graph/Chart should inlcude an interactive element. Here are some suggestions you can implement one of these or make up your own. 

- Buttons choose the data displayed
- Buttons change the type of chart/graph
