## CSS Grid

CSS Grid creates a 2 dimensional arrangement of child objects. 
Declaring a container as display: grid tells that container 
that it's children should be arranged in rows and columns.

properties. 

template columns 

template rows 

### Spreading elements across the grid

## Challenges 

Look at some web sites you think have good design. Identify the
grid that is used. Try and recreate this grid by mocking up
the site with some colored boxes. Do the same with one of your 
projects. 

You should create 5 mock ups. The mock ups should be made of colored 
boxes in HTML that display the general grid layout of two sites
that you think show good design and one for a site you created. 

You only need to mock these up. Give each section a color and 
label so it can be identified. 

1. Create one mock up each day of the week for 5 days. 

### Stretch Challenges 

1. Create 7 instead of 5.
