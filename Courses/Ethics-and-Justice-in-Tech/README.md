# Ethics and Justice in Tech 
## Don't Be Evil

## Course Description

The leaders of products, teams, and companies have the super power of analyzing and exploring the ethics of choices they and their communities make. Participants in this course will gain mastery in the super power of ethical reasoning by exploring the histories and ramifications of issues in technology that concern them. If we, as engineers, are going to build the future of technology, then we ought to look directly at the risks and benefits of compromising our privacy, the challenge of bias and diversity, the hopes and terrors of technological unemployment, the dream and nightmare of artificial intelligence, and many other issues that we face.

### Why Are We Learning This?

Learning ethics will help you directly in your career in multiple ways:

1. **Impact**—many people are concerned with not just working, but having a large impact on systems and the world. Ethical analysis will give you tools to assess the impact of your work and help you decide which projects you want to join.
1. **Behavioral Interviewing**—the depth of knowledge you bring to the ethical technical issues will differentiate you from other engineers that can only code.
1. **Leadership**—after one or two years as a junior engineer you will likely enter a role with more leadership and power. If you can do ethical analysis, you will be more likely to be promoted and you will do a better job of leading a team, product, or company.

## Attendance
Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
