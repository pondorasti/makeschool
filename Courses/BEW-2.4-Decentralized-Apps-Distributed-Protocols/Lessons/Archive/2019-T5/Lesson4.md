## Learning Objectives (5 Minutes)

1. Introduce the Node.js framework for writing dApps named Truffle.
2. Set up a dApps development environment on your own computer.
3. Practice smart contract development via the Ethereum Pet Shop tutorial.

## TT (20 Minutes)

Go over the [How to Build a dApp](https://www.slideshare.net/Codemotion/faisal-abid-adventures-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-how-to-build-a-decentralized-app-codemotion-berlin-2018) slides.

## In Class Activity I (15 Minutes)

### Set Up Development Environment

Install Truffle globally using these steps. They contain everything you need to get started with today's material!

1. **`npm install -g truffle`**: Download the box. This also takes care of installing the necessary dependencies.

2. **`truffle unbox pet-shop`**: Run the development console.

3. **`truffle develop`**: Compile and migrate the smart contracts.

   1. Run **`compile`** in the Truffle console.

   2. Run **`migrate`** in the Truffle console.

4. **`npm run dev`**: Run the development server (outside the development console) for front-end hot reloading.

**PROTIP**: **Smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated.**
