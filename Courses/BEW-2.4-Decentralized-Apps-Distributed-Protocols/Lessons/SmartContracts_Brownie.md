<!-- > -->

## [**25m**] ☀️ Warm Up: DApp Developer Roadmap

Review the DApps developer roadmap with students.

![DApp Developer Roadmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thecryptoshed/eth-dapp-developer-roadmap/master/dapp-developer-roadmap.png)

In breakout rooms (10 minutes), ask students to **identify where we are as a class on the roadmap**. When the breakout ends, use the remaining time to discuss and respond to student's answers.

<!-- > -->

## [**10m**] 📖 TT: Introduction to Brownie

Brownie is a **Python-based development and testing framework for smart contracts** targeting the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

### Use Cases

- **Deployment**: Automate the deployment of many contracts onto the blockchain, and any transactions needed to initialize or integrate them.
- **Interaction**: Write scripts or use the console to interact with your contracts on the mainnet, or for quick testing in a local environment.
- **Debugging**: Get detailed information when a transaction reverts, to help you pinpoint the issue quickly.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests in python and evaluate test coverage based on stack trace analysis. We make no promises.

### Features

- Full support for [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) and [Vyper](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper)
- Contract testing via [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest), including trace-based coverage evaluation
- Property-based and stateful testing via [hypothesis](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/tree/master/hypothesis-python)
- Powerful debugging tools, including python-style tracebacks and custom error strings
- Built-in console for quick project interaction
- Support for [ethPM](https://www.ethpm.com/) packages

## [**15m**] 💻 Activity: Install Brownie & Ganache

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites

:1234: You only need to **run these commands once per computer**. <br>
:gear: You should **use the script to install all prerequisites unless advised by your instructor.**

#### Install via Script

1. Open `Terminal.app`.
1. Copy the following command, then paste it into the terminal window:

    ```bash
    bash <(curl -sL https://make.sc/dappsetup)
    ```

#### Install Manually

|         Program | Version  |         Verify          | Install                                                       |
| --------------: | :------: | :---------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       **XCode** | _Latest_ |    `xcode-select -v`    | :one: [**App Store**: XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)<br>:two: `xcode-select --install` |
|        **Node** |   `12`   |        `node -v`        | :one: `nvm install 12`<br>:two: `nvm use 12`                  |
| **Ganache CLI** | _Latest_ | `ganache-cli --version` | :one: `npm install -g ganache-cli`                            |
|     **Brownie** | _Latest_ |   `brownie --version`   | :one: `pip3 install eth-brownie`                              |



### Step 2: Create First Project

#### 🛑 Read Before Starting

- If you **experience any errors** during the project creation process, please **exit the breakout room** for a one on one check in with the instructor.
- **_You only need to run these commands once per project._**

#### :1234: Step by Step

1. **Run `brownie bake token` to create your first project in a directory that does not contain spaces or periods**:

    ```bash
    $ cd ~/dev
    $ brownie bake token
    Brownie v1.11.2 - Python development framework for Ethereum

    Downloading from https://github.com/brownie-mix/token-mix/archive/master.zip...
    100%|█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 9.13k/9.13k [00:00<00:00, 2.60MiB/s]
    SUCCESS: Brownie mix 'token' has been initiated at /Users/dani/dev/token
    ```

1. **Navigate to the new `token` directory**:

    ```bash
    cd token
    ```

1. **Make sure the project is set up correctly by running the Brownie console**:

    ```bash
    $ brownie console
    Brownie v1.11.2 - Python development framework for Ethereum

    Compiling contracts...
      Solc version: 0.6.12
      Optimizer: Enabled  Runs: 200
      EVM Version: Istanbul
    Generating build data...
    - Token...
    - SafeMath...

    TokenProject is the active project.

    Launching 'ganache-cli --port 8545 --gasLimit 12000000 --accounts 10 --hardfork istanbul --mnemonic brownie'...
    Brownie environment is ready.
    >>>
    ```

1. **Type `exit()` in the Brownie console, then press `<ENTER>` to quit the Brownie console**.

    ```bash
    Brownie environment is ready.
    >>> exit()
    ```

1. **Open the project directory in your IDE** in order to prepare for the next activity.
1. **Exit the breakout room when done!**

## [**10m**] 📖 TT: Project Structure

### Project Structure

Each Brownie project uses the following structure:

- `contracts/`: Contract sources
- `interfaces/`: Interface sources
- `scripts/`: Scripts for deployment and interaction
- `tests/`: Scripts for testing the project

The following directories are also created, and used internally by Brownie for managing the project.  **You should not edit or delete files within these folders.**

- `build/`: Project data such as compiler artifacts and unit test results
- `reports/`: JSON report files for use in the GUI

## [**15m**] 💻 Activity: Common Brownie Commands

**In the project you just created, run:**

```bash
brownie console
```

**Discuss and write down the answers to following questions**:

- Have you seen similar consoles in the past?
- What is the purpose of this console?
- How to you exit this console?

**After exiting the console, run this command:**

```bash
brownie compile
```

**What did this command do? Why is it important?**


## [**10m**] 📖 TT: Introduction to the Console

Brownie’s console provides a simple way to perform on-the-fly testing and debugging, as well as interacting with contracts on a local or remote blockchain.

Check out this quick video for an example of the console's functionality:

## [**03m**] 🌃 After Class: Read the Docs

- **When you've completed the tutorial**:
    1. Visit [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/160564) and click on the assignment titled [[Day 7] Your First Token](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/160564/assignments/662647).
    1. Upload the `Token.json` file, located in the `build` directory of your `token` project.
        - **You MUST successfully run `brownie compile` inside of the `token` directory for this file to exist!**
- **Spend at least `30 minutes` reviewing the [Brownie Documentation](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#features).** Get familiar with the features. Be sure to write down any questions you have so we can discuss them together during the next class!
