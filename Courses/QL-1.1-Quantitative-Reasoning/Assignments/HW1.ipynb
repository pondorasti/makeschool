    "# HW1 - Covariance Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "**Covariance** is used to measure how two random variables change or vary together. For example, the height and weight of giraffes have a positive covariance because when one is big, the other tends to also be big.\n",
    "\n",
    "_In this assignment, we will calculate the **covariance matrix** for a given dataset._\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will consist of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTE:** in the video, the equation he uses has $n$ as the denominator, but when he calculates covariance values, he's using $n-1$ as the denominator. _For our purposes, we will be using $n-1$ as the denominator._\n",
    "\n",
    "Watch this video on covariance matrices: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GzMcUy7ZI0\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we can represent Covariance as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Cov(X,Y)=1/(n-1) \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x[i] - \\bar{x})(y[i] - \\bar{y})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n$ is the number of elements in arrays $x$ and $y$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python function that returns the covariance matrix for a given dataset, just like we watched in the video or any other dataset of your choosing. Below are various places you can get datasets from:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)\n",
    "- [Fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)\n",
    "- [Buzzfeed News](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/everything)\n",
    "- [Google Cloud BigQuery Public Datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/)\n",
    "- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download)\n",
    "- Can't find anything from above? Google around until you do!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Use [numpy's var function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.var.html) to confirm that the covariance between a variable and itself is the same as the variance of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, assuming your covariance function is named `cov`, ensure that the following is true: `cov(X, X) == np.var(X)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtain the covariance between columns $x$ and $y$, between columns $x$ and $z$, and columns $y$ and $z$\n",
    "1. The covariance between columns $x$ and $y$ is the same as the covariance between columns $y$ and $x$. _We can generalize this for any two columns_\n",
    "1. Show that the covariance between columns $x$ and $x$ is equal to the variance of column $x$. _We can generalize this for any other column_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Verify your code with numpy built-in `np.cov()` function as follows:"

    "\n",
    "To pass this assignment, you must meet the following requirements:\n",

    "1. Your function should return the covariance between 6 pairs of random variables: $(X,Y), (X, Z), (Y, Z), (X, X), (Y, Y), and (Z, Z)$\n",
