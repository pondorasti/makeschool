# Introduction to Ruby Part I

## Objectives

We are going to cover the basics of Ruby in a 2 part series. These are some of the topics we will cover:

- Variables & Symbols
- Classes, Modules, Objects & Methods
- Collections: Arrays, Hash maps
- Strings: concatenation, interpolation
- Control flow and iteration
- OOP in Ruby
- Debugging
- The Ruby REPL
- Using libraries: importing
- Error Handling
- Closures aka Blocks
- Useful standard library methods
- Structs

Here is the list of topics we will cover _today_:

# Why Ruby

Before we get started with Ruby, lets look at Ruby language and discuss why its important to learn it.

Ruby is the language for writing Rails applications. It has been around since 1985 and has developed an enourmous community of developers and enthusiats. Ruby focuses on developer productivity making the language easy and pleasant to write.

macOS ships with Ruby, so you don't have to explicitly install it.
Ruby is the language to build Rails applications. Ruby is to Python as Rails is to flask.

Ruby is a scripting language and is used extensively to build scripts for running.

Here are a few things built with Ruby:

- Homebrew
- Rails
- Cocoapods
- Fastlane

### How much Ruby do I need to build a Rails application?

For this course, we will only need basic Ruby which we are going to cover. If you have programmed in another language like Python or Swift, you know enough programming concepts to build a basic Rails application.

## Using Ruby Through the REPL

We can use Ruby in the terminal by running:

```shell
irb
```

This will pull up an interactive console for us to write Ruby.

## Ruby Style Guide

We are going to be following this style guide for writing our Ruby code. If you aren't sure about how to format a piece of ruby code refer to this:

[Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/ruby)

## Activities

- Reading and interoperating Ruby
- Translating Swift code to Ruby

## Challenges

Go through the Ruby Koans here:

## Assignments

In groups of three (3), pick and research one of the following topics to discuss for next class:

- Ruby Case Expressions & Ruby Iterators (for, while loops)
- Modules(Scope Resolution Operator) & Error Handling
- Closures aka Blocks
- Structs & Classes

Each team is going to present and teach the class on their topics of research. Provide code examples, walkthroughs and practical use cases for each topic of discussion.
