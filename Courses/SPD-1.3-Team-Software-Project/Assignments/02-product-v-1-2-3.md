## Work Planning
Use the following professional engineering team tips to maximize your progress in the course.

Tips:
1. **Tip 1: Utilize each Wednesday class as a Sprint Planning & Retrospective Meeting** - Each Wed class will start with a brief lesson and then you'll have 90 minutes to meet with your team.
1. **Tip 2: Create a slack channel for your team or consider meet daily before huddles for Standup**
1. **Tip 3: Pair or quad programming** start your project by pair programming - even quad programming - to ensure you all are aligned in terms of variable semantics, comment and module structure, etc ... 
1. **Tip 4: Get a technical advisor**: ask a technical instructor to be your advisor. You can ask them questions when your team gets stuck, include them in your slack channel, and ask for code reviews.
1. **Tip 5: Decided on your team's communication protocol**: decide when you will meet, how frequently. Decide how you will hold each other accountable.
1. **Tip 6: pick roles:** Each student should pick a primary role that they “own.” “Own” means that you are the individual directly responsible for executing that part of the project. In addition to owning an area, all students will contribute to other parts of the project.

     -  Gitmaster

        - Troubleshoots messy merges
        - Owns tracking issues and bugs
        - Owns documentation

1. **Tip 7: Clarify "Ownership":** In addition to the “area” role ownership above, teammates should own individual “tasks” - action items (often captured in trello) that have a defined deliverable and timeline. “Tasks” are assigned and reviewed during Sprint Planning meetings. You may do tasks outside of your “Area” of ownership.
1. **Tip 8: Be lean and iterative in your design:** wireframe and user test frequently. It doesn't take much time to do and can help you quickly test assumptions around product UI and ensure you are meeting user expecations and needs.


## Resources:
- **Daily Standup** - Make a slack channel for your team, or meet 15 minutes before huddles daily to share what you've accomplished, what you are working on, and any blockers. Just like a professional standup - this enables you to 
- **Sprint Planning Meetings (1 hour, weekly)** - *[Meeting Agenda Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n6IDYJ9jW2lWaTu5uf7qXEd3ihgQIByxsr-4RHjldBI/edit#heading=h.xffidahcubfs)*. Led by the PM. Team checks their roadmap and evaluate teams’ needs to decide what goes into the next sprint, and assign tasks. Teams can use [planning poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker) to estimate task effort. Everything is logged into Trello. You can copy this [Sprint Planning Trello Board template](https://trello.com/b/AU9r774H/kanban-board-template).
- **Sprint Retrospective (½ hour, weekly)** - *[Meeting Agenda Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n6IDYJ9jW2lWaTu5uf7qXEd3ihgQIByxsr-4RHjldBI/edit#heading=h.10t6cnudbcpw)*. Complete the old sprint board by checking all tickets and moving incomplete ones over to the next sprint board. Then estimate the tickets that the PM have moved into the board ahead of meeting. Go over what was completed, what went well not if it didn’t go so well, but double check how everyone felt. Anyone feel overloaded on work? Anything the PM could have done differently?
