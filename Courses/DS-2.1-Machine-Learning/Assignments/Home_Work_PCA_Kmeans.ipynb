    "In this homework, we'll examine the [**_Wholesale Customers Dataset_**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers), which we'll get from the UCI Machine Learning Datasets repository.  This dataset contains the purchase records from clients of a wholesale distributor.  It details the total annual purchases across categories seen in the data dictionary below:\n",

    "REGION| Geographic region of Portugal for each order (Nominal)\n",
    "FRESH| Annual spending (m.u.) on fresh products (Continuous);\n",
    "MILK| Annual spending (m.u.) on milk products (Continuous); \n",
    "GROCERY| Annual spending (m.u.)on grocery products (Continuous); \n",
    "FROZEN| Annual spending (m.u.)on frozen products (Continuous) \n",
    "DETERGENTS\\_PAPER| Annual spending (m.u.) on detergents and paper products (Continuous) \n",

    "**_TASK:_** Read in `wholesale_customers_data.csv` from the `datasets` folder and store in a dataframe.  Store the `Channel` column in a separate variable, and then drop the `Channel` and `Region` columns from the dataframe. Scale the data and use PCA to engineer new features (Principal Components).  Print out the explained variance for each principal component. "
