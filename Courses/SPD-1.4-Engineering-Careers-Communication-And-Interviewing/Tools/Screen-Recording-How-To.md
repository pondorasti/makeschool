## Instructions

1. Go to your Application Launchpad and open the QuickTime Player application. The bar at the top of your screen should show `QuickTime Player`.

4. Make sure to save your recording once you're satisfied with it.

## Tips

1. If you are recording yourself doing an interview question, I find it easier to use a web-based coding editor such as [Repl.it](https://repl.it) so that everything stays in one window and it's super easy to compile and run (and share your solution with others!).
