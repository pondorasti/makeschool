## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, you will be able to describe and practice each of the communication-focused steps of the technical interviewing process:

- Restate the problem
- Ask clarifying questions
- State your assumptions
- Think out loud
  - Brainstorm solutions
  - Explain your rationale
  - Discuss tradeoffs
  - Suggest improvements

## Warm-Up

With a partner, recall *one* technical interview you have done in the past (at Make School or elsewhere).

- What was hard about it?
- How could you have done better?


## Activity: Practice Interview Communication

Interview Problem: *Write a function that takes two lists named a and b, and returns a list of common values that are in both lists.*

### Part 1: Restate the Problem

1. Write down your restatement of the problem
1. With a partner, share your statement with them
1. Compare and contrast your statements to ensure you both fully understand the problem
1. Give each other feedback on problem statements

### Part 2: Ask Clarifying Questions

1. On your own, list 3+ clarifying questions to ask the interviewer.
1. Once you’re done, compare with a partner, and refine your questions based on their feedback.

### Part 3: State your Assumptions

1. Write down your own assumptions
1. Share your assumptions with a partner, and refine based on their feedback.

### Part 4: Think out Loud

  1. Brainstorm solutions
  1. Explain your rationale
  1. Discuss tradeoffs
  1. Suggest improvements

### Communication Role Play

Breakout into pairs. One person is interviewer, the other is interviewee. Use the same practice question and interview each other.

### Practice Problem

Problem: *Given an array of n numbers that are all unique except for one duplicate, find the duplicate number.*
