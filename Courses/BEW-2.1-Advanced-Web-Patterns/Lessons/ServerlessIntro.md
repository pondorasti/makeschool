<iframe height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KngM5bfpttA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Then, get hands-on with your first serverless application by running the [Hello World Node.js Example on AWS](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/examples/hello-world/node/) in your own terminal.

Once it's working, modify the code to return you and your partner's names instead!
