    "\n",
    "**1.**  The average height of students at Make School is 5'7\", with a standard deviation of 2.5 inches.  What percentage of Make School students are between 5'5\" and 6' tall?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**2.**  The average startup in San Francisco raises 1.5 million dollars with a standard deviation of 400,000 dollars.  Your boss wants to raise a 3 million dollar seed round.  Based only on how other startups have done, what are the odds (percentage chance) that he will be successful?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**3.**  You've decided to track the number of jokes Alan makes at Mike's expense during a given class period.  Alan averages 2.5 jokes about Mike per class, with a standard deviation of .7 jokes.  Mike has had a rough day, and will probably start crying if Alan makes more than 2 jokes about him today.  What is the percentage chance that Mike will NOT break down crying in class today?\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** To solve these questions, you can use a lookup-table for the Z-score, or just use the stats package inside of scipy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the cumulative area to the **left** of a Z-score, use the cumulative density function.\n",

    "<br>\n",

    "To compute the cumulative area to the **right** of a Z-score, use the survival function.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<center>`st.norm.sf(z-score)`</center>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that to calculate a Z-score for a particular point, you need to **_normalize_** it by subtracting the mean from that point, and then dividing that number by the standard deviation.  "
