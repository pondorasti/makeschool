# CS 1.3: Core Data Structures & Algorithms

## Course Description

This course explores the foundations of computer science including discrete mathematics, abstract data types, data structures, and algorithm analysis and design. Students will compare and contrast iterative and recursive algorithms to analyze design and performance tradeoffs. 

Students will implement and test data structures including lists, stacks, queues, sets, maps, and trees. Students will then apply these to real-world problems like phone call routing to understand their tradeoffs. Students will also write technical blog articles about these topics to deepen understanding, improve technical writing, and bolster their online presence as knowledgeable and proficient software engineers.

## Prerequisites

Students must pass the following course and demonstrate mastery of its competencies:

* [CS 1.2: Introduction to Data Structures](https://make.sc/cs12-repo)

## Assignments

### Coding Modules

Each lesson will have an associated module consisting of review, conceptual, and coding activities as well as interview prep related to the topic. At the end of each week you will turn your module work into gradescope for feedback and a score.

### Technical Article

Students will also write a technical article about a topic related to course content to deepen their understanding, improve their technical writing skills, and demonstrate mastery of computer science, which will bolster their online presence as knowledgeable and proficient software engineers.

## Assignment Submissions

We will be using [Gradescope](gradescope.com), which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. *All assigned work will be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope.*

As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your Gradescope login is your Make School email, and your password can be changed at [https://gradescope.com/reset_password](https://gradescope.com/reset_password). The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.

## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

* Pass all modules with a score 70% or higher
* Your lowest module will be dropped
* Complete and publish the Technical Article by the end of the term
* Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
* Make up all classwork from all absences

## Course Policies and Format

* This course will use a self paced format
* You will be given recommended dates to turn assignments in to stay on track, but you can turn in any assignment later than the recommended date with no penalty provided Modules 1-3 are turned in no later than midterm (Fri June 25th) and modules 3-7 and the technical article are turned in no later than the last day of class (Fri July 16th) 
* You can resubmit any assignment after receiving feedback to improve your score provided it is turned in no later than the last day of class (Fri July 16th)
* Assignments should be completed by the recommended date in the above schedules section in order to receive timely feedback. Students falling behind should connect with the instructor for help staying on pace! 
* The absolute last date to turn in Modules 1-3 is Fri June 25th and  the last date to turn in modules 3-7 and the technical article is Fri July 16th
* Any assignments not complete by the above midterm Fri June 25th and final day of class Fri July 16th dates will receive a score of 0
* Lectures will be given during the first hour of class and will be optional (9:30 am - 10:30 am on M & W)
* Labs will be during the last portion of the class and all of Friday sessions and attendance will be required (10:45 - 11:15 am M & W, 9:30 am - 11:15 am F)
