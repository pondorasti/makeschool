## Why You Should Know This

The ability to **create custom middleware that augments the request/response cycle** is crucial for all Systems Engineers.

## Learning Objectives (5 min)

1. Identify and describe what a middleware is, and why you'd use the technique in your APIs or backend architectures.
2. Design your first custom middleware.
3. Implement a middleware that detects whether or not a request is coming from inside the building.

## Initial Exercise (30 min)

- Finish the activity from last class period.
- If you've already completed the activity, make sure to slack out the GitHub repo.
- Ask Dani for a stretch challenge related to your group project!

## Overview/TT (20 min)

Go over the [Echo Middleware Cookbook](https://echo.labstack.com/cookbook/middleware) with the class.

## BREAK (10 min)

## In Class Activity I (55 min)

### Custom Make School Middleware

Your deliverable today is to **create a custom Echo middleware** that detects whether or not a particular request is coming from inside the building.

#### Challenges

1. Within a group of three, **brainstorm why one would be interested in detecting if a request came from a certain place**. What technique and technology could you use to detect this?
1. Write a custom Echo middleware that can detect this.
1. **Deliverable**: Slack out your technique and final code by end of class today.
