## Project Requirements
- You will work solo on your project - not with a partner. This allows you to work on the full stack instead of just the parts of the project you are most comfortable with.
- You can help your peers debug their code.
- Your product can be the idea you developed in SPD or a new project. But it has to be started and completed within this week.

### Tips
- **Product idea choice** - The project can be building a product off of your idea from SPD class, or it can be a new product. It cannot simply be a repurposing of a contractor project that was done in a technical course.
- **Scope the project small** - Remember not to over scope your first iteration. It should be a "skateboard" version of your idea, so simple that it barely meets your user need - check out these [class slides on scoping your project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UKVsUOCxQPNT3P42cvsTYxhNl7lpsDHjJew_a5K1JaM/preview?slide=id.p) for reference.  In the future, we'll use this [portfolio project rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nd70y0jzxD31mgxvwxgXxUY_Bi4YAN_kX9To_M0UilI/preview) to evaluate and level-up your shipped products.

## Product Submission
Product submission happens during Product Pitches on Friday from 3:00-5:00pm - in small groups, each student will present their product and check in with an instructor or staff member to get approval. We’ll also send a form to you input your link to your app / code on Github.
