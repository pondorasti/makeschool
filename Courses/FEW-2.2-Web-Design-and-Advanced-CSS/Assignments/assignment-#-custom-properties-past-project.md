# FEW 2.2 - Updating a past project with CSS Custom Properties

Apply CSS Custom proeprties to your past work. 

## Description 

Your goal is to improve a past project by implementing CSS custom properties. 

The goal is to improve past code and practice using Custom Properties. 

### Why this assignment?

Learning a new feature is good putting it into practice is even better. This is an oppertunity for you to practice your  craft as a programmer, possibly in an area where you don't normally work. 

This is also an opportunity to improve your portfolio by improving a past project. 

## Project requirements

Identify a project that could benefit from the addition of CSS custom properties. This should be just about any web project with a stylesheet. 

Apply CSS Custom Properties in the following ways: 

- Replace repeated values with a custom property (this makes DRY code)
- Move values that control the appearance of your site to the top of the page. (makeds your code easier to manage)
- Use `calc()` to calculate related value (makes DRY code)

### Deliverable

Your goal is to improve the CSS used in a previous project. You'll do this by making a new branch and working with that branch implement the changes. 

Start by choosing a project that you will improve. This can be any past web project using CSS. If your previous project used Bootstrap you'll need to remove boot strap which will mena you'll need to work with the layout. We will be working with CSS grid in the future so you can leave changes to the layout till then. 

The goal of this assignment is improve the typography. That's all you need to focus on for now.
