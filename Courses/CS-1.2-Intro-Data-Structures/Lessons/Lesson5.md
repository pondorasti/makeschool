## Lists

So far we have talked about the idea of a list and two different ways to implement one

- static array
- dynamic array

## Linked List

A Linked List is another way to implement the idea of a list. Its key different is that it is non-contiguous in memory.

## Linked List Components

- Node

    - next
We can think of the data as the treasure and the next as a clue to the next Node (treasure location)
