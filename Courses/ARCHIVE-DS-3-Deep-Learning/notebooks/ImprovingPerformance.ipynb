    "<center><h1>Techniques For Improving Neural Network Performance</h1></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first three notebooks, we learned about the basics of building a deep neural network, and a litte bit about the basic architecture.  We learned about the history of Single-Layer Perceptrons, what each neuron actually calculates, the different activation functions we can use to capture non-linearity in our model, and finally about the almight backprop algorithm that allowed our Multilayer Perceptron to \"learn\" the proper values for every parameter in the model, even though all those weights and biases started out as random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll learn about a few different small-but-handy tricks that can make our models more more accurate, faster to train, and more resilient to overfitting.  Let's briefly examine the topics we'll cover in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><h3>1. Dropout Layers</h3></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Dropout_** is a **_regularization technique_** designed to help prevent the model from **_overfitting_**.  It works by giving every neuron in a given layer a dropout percentage, which is the percentage chance that the neuron will be turned off rather than passing along it's input.  In this lesson, we'll learn about how this technique forces our neural networks to learn to be more resilient by probabilistically \"killing off\" neurons during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><h3>2. Hyperparameter Tuning</h3></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Hyperparameter Tuning_** is the hardest of the three topics we'll cover in this notebook.  Just as we used GridSearchCV to find the best combination of parameters for our models in DS2, we'll explore strategies for Hyperparameter Tuning to find the best combination for our Neural Networks in this notebook.  You'll likely find hyperparameter tuning for DS3 much harder and more time consuming than it was in DS2--neural networks have many more hyperparameters, and take longer to train, which means that combinatoric approaches like GridSearch are usually untenable. In this notebook, we'll explore the hyperparameters we should tune, and strategies for how to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><h2>Getting Started: Underfitting and Overfitting</h2></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In DS2, we learned about how to evaluate the **_fit_** of our models.  Recall that in any supervised learning scenario, we split our data into training and testing sets.  Our training set is used to help our model learn insights from the data that it will use to make inferences to predict a class (classification tasks) or continue value (regression tasks).  Ideally, the model has learned just enough information from the training data to be generalizable to the real world.  If the model did learn enough about the training data to accurately make predictions, we say that the model has **_underfit_** the data.  If the model has mistaken variance in the training data for information it can use to make predictions, it will not generalize well to the real world.  Underfitting as if your model is blind to the answers in front it--overfitting is as if it is hallucinating.  \n",

    "**_Scenario_**\n",
    "You're a star student in high school, and you have a big test coming up in an AP (or IB, whichever you prefer) test coming up.  In order to study for the test, you buy two study books, like the one seen in the picture above.  These study books contain test questions that are a **_representative sample_** of the questions you'll see on the actual test.  They cover the same material, have the same format, and were probably written by the same people.  More importantly, all of the questions in these study books also come with with labeled answers for each question in the back of the book, so that you can check your work.  In order to mix it up, you pool all the questions from both books into one giant test (our **_training set_**), and then randomly set aside 25% of the practice questions (our **_test set_**).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your study method is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>**_Training_**</center> \n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>  Grab a question from your training set and try to answer it as if you were taking the real test. (**_forward propagation_**)</li>\n",
    "    <li> Check the answer in the back of the book to see if you got the question right or wrong.</li>\n",
    "<ul><li style='margin-top: -15px'>If you got it right, do nothing. You clearly already know this part of the material. No adjustment needed.</li>\n",
    "<li>If you got it wrong, study that question and try to learn from your mistake. (**_back propagation_**)  </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<li>During this process, keep a running total of your grade on the training set.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "When you've worked through all the questions in the training set, it's time to do a sanity check and make sure you actually know the material as well as you think you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>**_Testing_**</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you sit down and answer all the questions in your testing set start to finish.  When you've finished, you flip to the back of the book to the answers to grade yourself.  You now have two grades to compare--your **_training score_**, and your **_testing score_**.    \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "<center><img src='img/scenario_table.jpg' height=35% width=35%></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Scenario 1: Underfitting:_**  If our score on both the training and testing sets are low, we can probably assume that our understanding of the material (our _model_) is lacking.  We don't yet know the material as well as we should, or we are biased towards what we think is correct, rather than what the data shows us is correct.  We can remedy this in a couple ways: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Remedies:\n",
    "1. Spending more time training by working through our training data--maybe you didn't practice enough!\n",
    "1. Increase the complexity of your model--maybe you have an oversimplified view of the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Scenario 2: Good Fit:_** If we score pretty much the same on our training and testing sets, and the scores are good scores, we can be confident that we actually understand the material that will be on the real AP Test.  We're not _guaranteed_ that we will do well on the test, but based on the information that we had to work with (the data contained within our practice test books), we can assume that we're as prepared as we possibly can be.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Remedies:\n",
    "None.  \"It ain't broke, so don't fix it!\" --Galileo (probably)\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Scenario 3: Overfitting:_** In this scenario, we can see that our training score is significantly higher than our testing score.  This is probably because we have accidentally \"discovered\" something in our training data that only applies to our training data through coincidence, or we've been through the training questions so many times that we have inadverently memorized the answers to each question without actually understanding _why_ that is the correct answer.  There are several ways we can remedy this as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Remedies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get more training data.  The more practice questions we have to go through, the less likely we are to mistake coincidence for something that will help us on the test.  For example, if we only had 10 questions, it's completely possible that we could mistakenly think we've discovered some random \"trick\" that helps us score well on the practice questions, but doesn't actually work on test questions in the real world (e.g. \"In the training data, I noticed that the answer to the even-numbered questions is 'B'!\").  The more data you have, the more counterexamples you'll have that will make it harder to accidentally \"learn\" incorrect patterns in the data.  \n",
    "1. Use regularization to simplify your model.  Simpler is better.  We've all gotten questions wrong before because we overthought.  Simpler models are always preferable to more complex models (as long as the models aren't so simple that they _underfit_ the data).  Regularization adds a penalty for complexity, reducing the overall complexity and making things simpler.  In this analogy, maybe you're considering 10 different things when you answer a question. If this is too complex, it might not generalize well to the real world test.  In that case, try only considering 5 or 6 things on each question, and see if it improves your score.  \n",

Essentially, every neuron has a 50% chance of \"dropping out\", hence the name.  This may sound like a bad idea at first, but it's actually pretty intuitive.  Consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dropout and Basketball\n",
    "\n",
    "You're a high school basketball coach, with a team consisting of average players.  After a few games, you notice that some players play really well when they're on the court together.  In practice as well as games, they spend all their time running plays together.  This works great with every teammate learning to play really with well a partner, co-adapting to each other's performance--that is, until certain players are sick or injured, and can't play.  Now, you lose games, because your players didn't get enough practice playing basketball on their own, or with other random partners.  They only play well with the players they co-adapted with.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple--you should just randomly bench certain players during practice, forcing each player to learn and adapt to the play well with anyone else on the court. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly the type of situation that dropout prevents in a neural network.  It's actually a bit more complex, because with Neural Networks, we don't actually know which neurons will or won't be the \"star players\".  Instead, we give them all an equal chance of dropping out, forcing the remaining neurons in the network to \"learn\" the correct weights with the teammates they have. \n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, dropout layers are only turned on during the training phase. During testing, all neurons are present, and none will drop out.  This makes sense, too--it's one thing to bench players during practice, but we need everyone ready to contribute during the game.  \n",
