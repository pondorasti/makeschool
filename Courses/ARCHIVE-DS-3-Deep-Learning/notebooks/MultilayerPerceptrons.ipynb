    "So far in this course, we've learned about Single Layers Perceptrons--the precursors to modern neural networks.  We've also learned about the activation functions used in neural networks, and the symbolic relationship they have with neurons in a brain. In this lesson, we'll put it all together and create a **_Multilayer Perceptron_** that uses multiple layers of neurons.  We'll use it to classify different types of clothing from the _Zalando Fashion Dataset_, a more complex dataset used for benchmarking and practice, in the same way that MNIST is used.  To build it, we'll use the [**_Keras_**](https://keras.io/) library--in industry-standard tool used by Deep Learning practicioners to quickly create Deep Neural Network prototypes.  Keras gives us all the power of Google's [**_TensorFlow_**](https://www.tensorflow.org/) framework, but with a clean, easy-to-use API that abstracts away all the boilerplate code needed to get TensorFlow working.\n",

    "\n",
    "This perceptron generally worked, but wasn't too effective at learning--with only one layer, it's just too simple to learn complex nonlinear functions.  Multilayer perceptrons solve this problem by stacking at least 3 layers of neurons together. At minimum, a Multilayer Perceptron must consist of:\n",

We'll discuss what they do, why they are considered 'hidden', and how they fit into modern Deep Neural Networks further along in this assignment.  Before we get to that, let's explore the history (and drama) that took us from Single-Layer Perceptrons to the powerful modern Neural Networks we use nowadays.\n",

    "<center><h3>Some History on Perceptrons (Nerd Drama Ahead!)</h3></center>\n",

    "<center><img src='img/mlp-network.png' height=80% width=80%></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following analogy, it's helpful to think of each neuron as a person giving advice to the people in the following layer.  The people in the first layer take a look at the inputs, and (based on their weights from the previous layer, plus a bias), pass along their advice to each person in the next layer, who repeat this process until it gets to the person at the very end.  Based on the advice he received from the previous layer, who based their advice on the information they received from the previos layey (and so on and so on), the person makes a decision, which turns out to be wrong.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to a really tough question--**_how do we divide up the \"blame\" for this mistake?_** \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about all the ways this group of people (or neurons) could have gotten this wrong. What if everybody's weights and biases were wrong (meaning everyone gave bad advice)? Or, what if some people have perfected exactly how much weight they should give the inputs they receive, but the inputs themselves were bad? What if every neuron was perfect, but one was way off?  How would you even know which one? If we knew who to blame, and how much to blame them, we could shift their weights accordingly and let everyone \"learn\" from each mistake in the training data--but this wasn't possible, because we hadn't yet figured out how to tell who we should blame for a mistake (which weights we should adjust), and how much we should blame them (which would tell us how to adjust the weights accordingly).\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the central problem with neural networks, and the central insight behind the **_back propagation alogrithm_** (backprop for short) that powers the learning in modern neural networks. Although there were many pieces of the backprop algorithm invented as far back as 1960, no one really fully put all the pieces together until 1986, when Geoffrey Hinton, David Rummelhart, and Ronald J. Williams put all the pieces together and came up with the generalized backpropagation algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that until backprop was invented, no one really realized just how powerful Neural Networks could be. Although people were very excited about Rosenblatt's invention of the SLP in 1957, this excitement died down in 1969 when Marvin Minsky published the book _Perceptrons_, which made strong claims that Perceptrons were only good for toy problems.  He showed proofs that a SLP can't solve the [XOR problem](https://www.quora.com/What-is-XOR-problem-in-neural-networks).  Once Hinton and team discovered backprop and compputers continued to get more and more powerful, that set the stage for the amazing Deep Learning explosion that we see today!\n",

    "\n",
    "<center><h2>Nuts and Bolts: Forward Prop and Back Prop</h2></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we train a neural network, what is actually happening? This can be summarized as two main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **_Forward Propagation_**\n",
    "2. **_Back Propagation_**\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks learn from training data in a similar way that we learn from doing practice problems and then checking to see if we got the answer correct.  First, we figure out an answer, and then we double check the answer to see if we got it right or wrong.  If we got it right, great--we understand how to solve that problem.  Don't change anything.  But when we get it wrong, we go back and figure out how we got it wrong, and shift our thinking.  This is generally what neural networks are doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we build a working MLP in Keras, let's take a quick look at what happens during the forward prop and back prop steps for each data point in the training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><h3>Forward Propagation</h3></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each feature for a row of data is passed in to a different neuron in the **_input layer_**.  If our dataset has 20 columns (often referred to as \"dimensions\"), then each column will be passed into a separate column meant just for it.  This data will then feed to every neuron in the first hidden layer.  Each neuron will then compute the weighted sum of the inputs it receives (which is just the [dot product](https://mathinsight.org/dot_product_examples) of the inputs and weights), plus a bias.  The neuron then passes this weighted sum through an activation function, which we learned in the last notebook lets our networks capture nonlinearity.  The number that the activation function spits out is the output of this neuron, which is also the input that will be passed on to all neurons in the next layer.  This pattern continues, passing information from **_hidden layer_** to hidden layer until the information reaches the **_output layer_**.  This output of the output layer is the prediction that the neural network has made for the data passed to it as input.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><h3>Back Propagation</h3></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Loss:_**\n",
    "Since this is an instance of data from our training set, that means we have a label to check to see if the prediction made during the forward propagation step was correct.  To check our performance, we'll use a **_Loss Function_**.  You've already run across these when learning about things like regression--for example, the Sum of Squared Errors is a loss function.  The goal of the neural network during training is to shift the weights in a way that will minimize this loss function.  When it gets an a prediction correct, the loss will be 0.  This is a good thing, because if we got something correct, there's no reason to change the weights/biases around--this could do more harm than good!  However, when the network gets a prediction wrong, things get interesting.  Did it predict 0 when the label was 1, or 1 when the label was 0?  When learning from mistakes, how the network got something wrong is just as important as recognizing the mistake at all.  A clever loss function will tell us this. There are many clever loss functions in deep learning, but they are all generally some form of $y - \\hat{y}$, where $y$ is the actual label, and $\\hat{y}$ is the prediction made during the forward prop step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Gradient Descent_**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we output from our loss function, we can take the derivative of this loss function. If we have the derivative of this loss function, we can shift the weights up or down and see which direction decreases our loss.  If we have enough training data, and we shift the weights incrementally in a direction that decreases the loss every time we make a mistake, eventually we'll arrive at optimal values for each weight.  In layman's terms, our network will have \"learned\" the weights that will cause it to get the most predictions correct.  For an example, see the following diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src='img/gradient_descent.png' height=60% width=60%></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Back Propagating the Error_**\n",
    "If our neuron only had one weight, gradient descent would be easy--we just shift the value for that weight in the correct direction every time until we have a gradient of 0. However, we have many different neurons in our network. What do we do? If you're familiar with calculus, you've probably heard of the **_Chain Rule_**. Our derivative of our loss function is decomposable.  After all, our loss comes from the output layer, but the input to that output layer was other functions, which also had inputs that were the outputs of other functions, all the way back to the beginning.  We can trace this chain backwards, taking the derivative at every step to propagate the error backwards and tell each neuron how to shift it's own weights, all the way back to the beginning! When we put all of this together, this is how we solve the blame assignment problem, which allows us to build very deep networks that can still assign \"blame\" appropriately and learn the correct weights with enough training data!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(A quick note--you may be wondering where the initial values for the weights and biases for each neuron come from, before the first forward prop step on the first data point.  The simple answer is that they are just random values.  this is okay, because the network will \"learn\" the correct weights during the backprop step described below!)\n",

For those that are looking for an additional challenge, try tuning your hyperparameters and comparing your results! Keep track of how each does, and see if you can get a feel for what makes the model perform better, and what makes it perform worse.  \n",

    "1. Layer width--how does changing the number of neurons in a layer affect the performance of the model?\n",

If you make too many changes at once, you won't know how to **_assign blame!_** (See what I did there? Thats a backprop joke.  Admit it.  That was clever.)"
