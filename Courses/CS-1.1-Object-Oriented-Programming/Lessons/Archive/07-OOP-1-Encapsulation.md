## [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H3c4ZxOX5mkEFH6xJ4EUJOzenPrpa82tK3WBsNZA0NQ/edit?usp=sharing)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Appreciate why Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is useful in software design
- Explain OOP concepts and define OOP-related technical vocabulary
- Apply OOP concepts by modeling a real-world situation with OOP relationships

## Learn Why OOP is Useful
- Read this article on the [Advantages of Using Object-Oriented Programming][] (10 min)
- Discuss and debate the four ideas presented in the article with a group of 3-4 students (10 min)
- Discuss the ideas presented in the article as a class, share examples and define vocabulary (30 min)
  - Encapsulation: class, object, instance, attribute, method
  - Inheritance: subclass (aka child or derived class), superclass (aka parent or base class)
  - Polymorphism: method override

Break (5 min)

## Model a Team with OOP
- Form a group of 3-4 students
- Create a shared document for everyone to work in together
- Model a team with Object-Oriented Programming (40 min)
  - Select a team sport (or organization) that involves people in several different roles
  - Define at least 3 classes, one for each role on the team/organization
  - Choose 2-3 attributes and 2-3 behaviors the roles exhibit
  - Define a superclass of which each role is a subclass
  - Abstract common attributes and behaviors the subclasses inherit from the superclass
  - Distinguish attributes and behaviors that differ between roles and are included only in the subclasses
- Two groups share the team structure they created with the class (10 min)
